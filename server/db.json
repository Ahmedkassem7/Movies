Everyone is on edge because the murderer has not been caught. The most substantial pieces of evidence the police have are hand written letters by the murderer which he sent to the newspaper for publication. Unknown even to himself, a blind beggar, who sold the murderer a balloon for one of the child victims, may have key information as to the murderer's identity. The murder squad's work is made even more difficult with the large number of tips they receive from the paranoid public, who are quick to accuse anyone of suspicious activity solely for their own piece of mind that someone - anyone - is apprehended for the heinous crimes. Conversely, many want to take the case into their own hands, including the town's leading criminals since the increased police presence has placed a strain on their ability to conduct criminal activity. Although they both have the same end goal of capturing the murderer, the police and the criminals seem to be working at cross purposes, which may provide an edge to the murderer in getting away.",

Both lead actors do a good job.  The film has a clear story arc but does not tie up chronic mental health issues in a tidy bow.  Mark has been in a stable and fulfilling relationship with Jonah for several years.  He begins to withdraw physically and emotionally.  Jonah broaches the issue and notes that, when Mark had stopped taking his medication a year go, he'd asked Jonah to tell him is his behavior started getting strange.  He encourages Mark to go back on his previous medication.  Instead, Mark schedules couples counseling as he perceives he simply doesn't care about Jonah anymore but would like to try to re-establish a good relationship.  Mark fails to implement the counselor's recommendations, and fails to effectively address his mental health issues.  He does not address the personal and professional stressors he has going on, self medicates with alcohol takes other drugs, and, when he finally chooses to return to taking medication does not resume the med that he'd had success with just a year before.",

              "content": "In the quiet words of the Virgin Mary... come again?\r\n\r\nSnatch seems to be one of those spunky British gangster films that critics are divided on, yet it's loved by the target audience. Guy Ritchie has done a Sam Raimi, he has remade the first film that put him on the cinematic map. Where Raimi remade The Evil Dead, and just called it Evil Dead II, Ritchie cheekily tries to get away with remaking Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels and calling it Snatch. Sure the circumstances in plotting are different, and there's a big American star brought in to beef things up for the global market, but it's the same movie and without doubt it's lazy film making. But it still - like Evil Dead II - Rocks!\r\n\r\nSnatch in story terms is concerned with a big diamond that stitches together a number of threads involving the London underworld. Some rough and tough Romany types join in the fun, headed by a purposely illegible Brad Pitt, while Dennis Farina, Benicio Del Toro and Rade Serbedzija add more cosmopolitan meat to the crooks and gangster stew. The British cement holding the building up comes in the twin forms of Jason Statham and Stephen Graham, with Vinnie Jones once again turning up to frighten the masses. Everything from bare knuckle fighting to bumbled robberies - to dog fighting and shifty arcade empires - are here, with Ritchie writing characterisations that positively boom off of the screen. \r\n\r\nAs with \"Lock-Stock\", the beauty is in the way violence and humour are deftly blended. Scenes are often bloody but also bloody funny, a pearl of dialogue is never far away from a perilous situation. The comic tone is more close to the knuckle here, Ritchie having fun toying with ethnic and machismo stereotypes, while he brings his bag of visual tricks before it got boring. The narrative is deliciously complex, but much credit to Ritchie for the way he pulls all the threads neatly together in a whirl of scene splicing and cocky literary assuredness.\r\n\r\nSo it's \"Lock-Stock 2\" then! No bad thing if you happen to be a fan of that sort of wide boy malarkey. If you don't like it? Then jog on sunshine. 8/10",

              "content": "Well, when the credits started to roll I cannot say that I felt it had been a waste of time and money. I did indeed have some enjoyment watching this movie. However, it could have been a lot better.\r\n\r\nFor starters, what is the point of making a movie about a bloody “dinosaur shark” and aim for a PG-13 rating? Whoever made that incredibly stupid decision obviously missed the mark big time. I think this was the biggest fault with the movie. There were so many missed opportunities. The entire scene at the beach at the end of the movie was just wasted for example.\r\n\r\nThe script was of course somewhat illogical with holes in it large enough to drive a, well, a Megalodon through them. This however was something that I more or less expected given the kind of movie. First of all it is science fiction and fantasy after all and second, it appears that these kind of movies never seem to get anything better than mediocre script writers…at best.\r\n\r\nThere were some good things though. I have read the book and I didn’t really like it. In my review I gave it 2 out 5 five stars. The main reason for this was that the book was more of a bad soap opera than a horror/thriller. It was so filled with unlikable, scheming and backstabbing assholes that it was really not enjoyable. Jason’s ex wife was such a despicable bitch that she alone ruined the book for example.\r\n\r\nLuckily the movie had toned down that aspect of the book quite a lot. Actually, in the end, there was really only one truly despicable asshole in the movie and he met with the fate that he deserved thanks to his own stupidity.\r\n\r\nSo, I did enjoy the movie and, as a science fiction and fantasy fan, I am glad to have watched it. I mean, a giant pre-historic shark on the big screen does have a certain cool-factor after all. It was somewhat saved by Jason Statham being in it though and it could have been a lot better.",

              "content": "Child friendly horror...\r\n\r\nYou have to take in to context the post release statements by director Jon Turteltaub and lead actor Jason Statham. The Meg is not the film they either read on the page or filmed as a course of grisly schlock entertainment. This was meant to be a proper schlocker, a bloodletting monster of the deep on the loose picture, sadly the suits at the helm didn't see that as a viable money making exercise and had this cut to be a \"12\" friendly bums on theatre seats cash grabber. Shame on them.\r\n\r\nWhat we get is a run of the mill creature feature that although once viewed does not leave a lasting impression (was anyone really hoping for that anyway?), but is kind of fun in that time filling sort of way. It runs through the modern day creature feature playbook 101. So off we go with the hero having a troubled backstory, a money made funder out of his depth, ladies with life quandaries, a man who can't swim working in the middle of the ocean! and on we go. Throw in some quite awfully scripted dialogue and it's cheese sarnie time.\r\n\r\nStatham is nearly always a good watch - in the muscle bound action hero kind of way - though you see the cracks between what the film was meant to be and what it ended up as. For you see that The Stath comes off as taking it all too seriously, which in this released cut is ridiculous. He's surrounded by no mark actors, though no short supply of beauty (Bingbing Li socko gorgeous/Ruby Rose hard sexy) and the narrative feeds us all the pointers of exactly where this will end up. There's a couple of nifty fun homages to Jaws, some decent suspense scenes, and the cinematography (Tom Stern) is pin sharp and pleasurable.\r\n\r\nBest bet to enjoy this is to know it's a \"12\" rated friendly piece, to understand it has ultimately ended up as a same old same old monster movie. It's a million miles away from the class of Jaws, and lacks the tongue in cheek knowing of Deep Blue Sea, but it fills a gap in that undemanding time wasting way. 5/10",

Even on an IMAX screen, it moves along with all the pace of a milk-float even despite the lively contributions from the enthusiastic Jason Statham as he attacks the leviathan with a glorified Stanley knife.

The effects and story just didn't do it for yours truly.\r\n\r\n<em>'Jaws'</em> (obviously) and even <em>'Piranha'</em> did it better, this one doesn't have anything fresh to add to the subgenre of man-eating fish. It kinda does its own thing for the first half, however by the end it really could just be a flick from either of those two named franchises.\r\n\r\nAs noted, I did like those onscreen. Jason Statham isn't at his best but is nevertheless effortlessly entertaining. He, Li Bingbing and Sophia Cai are a cute trio. Cliff Curtis is pretty solid too. Page Kennedy is OK, I remember him from TV's <em>'Rush Hour'</em> (I'm one of a few that actually saw and enjoyed that show).\r\n\r\nI can't imagine the sequel turned out any better.

His trademark fast-forward, HFR (high frame rate) type of action doesn't appeal to many viewers, and his nonlinear narrative structure is often more confusing than captivating. At least, these are the common complaints across his filmography. While I acknowledge that these attributes don't always work, I'm actually quite a fan of his filmmaking techniques. From his more recent work on Aladdin and The Gentlemen to his take on classic characters such as Sherlock Holmes and King Arthur: Legend of the Sword, I genuinely enjoy Ritchie's risky, divisive approach on the best way to tell a story.\r\n\r\nGoing in completely blind to Wrath of Man, I honestly didn't have a good feeling. I expected a generic, hollow, forgettable action flick with a main actor who everyone has seen countless times in this genre. I just hoped it would be entertaining enough for me to have a decent couple of hours in front of the TV. Well, this movie might be 2021's best surprise to date! If Zack Snyder (Zack Snyder’s Justice League) is often criticized for his excessive use of slow-motion, Ritchie receives the exact same complaints but regarding his high-speed action scenes. This time, the latter leaves his well-known characteristics aside and proves that he's not a one-trick filmmaker.\r\n\r\nImpressively long, uncut takes - some reach the three-minute mark - help create a tremendously tense, suspenseful atmosphere throughout the entire runtime. Every scene is set up with patience and precise timing, making every single tiny movement from the camera and actors capture the audience's attention. Christopher Benstead's score is one of those examples that I will start giving people when they ask about impactful music in film. The heavy cello notes are incredibly ominous, establishing the mood of the whole environment in a way that will leave no viewer indifferent. Some of you might read the following as a critique, but the build-ups for each action scene steal the spotlight from the latter.\r\n\r\nWith that said, the shootouts and overall action are entertaining and well-filmed, which I believe will please a vast majority of spectators. Jason Statham (The Meg, Hobbs & Shaw) delivers a one-dimensional performance that would feel disappointing in any other movie, but it works for this protagonist. The main character is supposed to be mysterious and capable of anything, so it's only logical that he hides every ounce of emotion - even though it negatively affects a couple of dialogues. Furthermore, it's Jason Statham… moviegoers go see his films for his action skills, not his acting chops. When it comes to fire a gun or beat someone up, there are not that many actors who can do so as convincing as him.\r\n\r\nStory-wise, Ritchie didn't let go of his favorite narrative structure. Nonlinear storytelling is extremely difficult to pull off perfectly due to how easily it becomes confusing or messy. Fortunately, Wrath of Man features several storylines converging all in a single moment, which quickly demonstrates what the screenwriters plan to do. A mysteriously compelling first half transitions to a more predictable, formulaic second part where one of the storylines feels both tacked on and uninteresting. The secondary characters lack any sort of arc or random development, with the focus going completely into the protagonist's mission, whatever that may be.\r\n\r\nWrath of Man isn't a groundbreaking, mind-blowing, or even innovative action movie, but it's still one of the biggest, best surprises of the year. While it's true that Guy Ritchie still follows the genre formulas of success, he shocks everyone by leaving his trademark filmmaking techniques aside, delivering an incredibly tense film packed with suspenseful, one-take build-ups to energetic, riveting action sequences. Jason Statham's one-dimensional display works well enough for a mysteriously captivating protagonist who the viewers can easily root for once his true goal is revealed. Christopher Benstead's score tremendously elevates the entire movie, establishing an extremely gripping atmosphere. The nonlinear storytelling features parallel narratives that are not all interesting or necessary, ending with an ironically abrupt last scene, contradicting the overall steady pacing. In the end, it's a solid recommendation to watch in theaters if possible.\r\n\r\nRating: B+",

He's his usual cool self, but the story is weak and performance from Josh Hartnett is downright embarrassing, to say the least. Holt McCallany is decent, but in general the characters come off as two-dimensional. You really don't care about them. I panicked when I saw Jeffrey Donovan, because his appearance is seldom that impressive. He was okay though, far from the one to blame for this B-movie. It's not bad, but certainly not a masterpiece either.",

I can’t deny that the action grabs you by the throat and moves you along with it. Sometimes, however, it felt to me like instead of a storyboard they worked from a murderboard: “Okay, how many do we lose in this scene?”  Once again I am reminded of Hitchcock. Suspense is not a bomb going off; suspense is not knowing when or if it will explode.\r\n\r\nThey took a bit of trouble to make the plot seem more intricate than it was: having maybe three flashbacks do the work of one, for example. Some of that layering of plot could have been diverted to character building and development. Only our hero is given motivation and a back story, and there are even gaps in that.\r\n\r\nBut it should be remembered that these observations are by, and for, someone who is not a fan of action films. If you are a fan, then nothing I have written here should deter you from watching Wrath of Man.",

John Wick, Taken, Nobody, The Equalizer, and so many others have done the same thing. Apparently bullets don't do permanent damage to lead characters? Seriously, with the damage he takes in this film he should have spent the runtime changing a colostomy bag and being wheeled to the TV to watch cartoons while drooling down his chest. But, again, that's not unique to this film. It's kinda the standard now days. I guess when so many films seem to have the intention of being a franchise a character's mortality only becomes an issue if the actor doesn't renew their contract. \r\n\r\nIf you don't mind this issue, it's a really fun film.

I very much like Statham playing the silent, mysterious tough guy role. He is perfect in this role.\r\n\r\nThe movie builds up somewhat slowly but it does not take very long before Statham shows that he is not an ordinary security guy when he takes down some wannabe robbers with nothing less than extreme efficiency. A very cool scene.\r\n\r\nOn one side I like that the movie takes some time to build up the suspense and reveal the plot. In articular why Statham is there in the first place. On the other side the way the movie does it irks me somewhat. There just to much flashbacks for my taste and some events we are forced to watch from no less than three different perspectives. Felt a bit like a filler to me. Still, Statham’s passed and presents weaves together in a story that, to me, is quite good and not the everyday, run of the mill, revenge story. Quite well done actually.\r\n\r\nNot entirely surprising the movie builds up to a big showdown in the end. I very much liked it. Lots of action although I would have liked that they let a few more of the good guys actually survive. The death count on both sides was somewhat excessive.\r\n\r\nThe ending was satisfactory although from a point in the showdown, about twenty or minutes from the end, it was rather predictable.\r\n\r\nThe reason this movie gets four and a half (or 9 out of 10) stars instead of the full five out of five is only because of the flash backs which.

              "content": "Wednesday's plot focuses on it's surface between the balance of power between normal everyday people (Like you and I), and (I don't know a better way to put it) cryptid kids; Wednesday (played by Jenna Ortega) is part of the latter (obviously).  As the plot thickens, we find out that power struggle between the groups has been ingrained in everyone for generations. You may even say it's been institutionalized since the community's inception. \r\n\r\nPeople can read into this however they want; what really matters is if it works or not.  Given that the kids are literally werewolves, sirens, medusas and other cryptid creatures of lore, it is my opinion if you feel this dynamic is only in place to make you feel fragile, than you need  to (in the words of my grandfather) 'get a tougher skin'.  Honestly, it's a TV show, are you that wounded?\r\n\r\nAs these kids are in fact literally and physically outcasts to our society, their struggles being so and trying to fit in work in this story.  I believe because Wednesday isn't physically a cryptid people expected something else.  She's always been, along with her whole family obviously not normal and thus outcasts like the rest. \r\n\r\nWhat I really enjoyed about this is the dynamic between Jenna and the un-talking member of the Adams' family, Thing (physically played by **Victor Dorobantu**).  The actor wears a green suite except for his hand and contorts his way through every scene. The result is a way more realistic human hand running around than any CGI could have ever done. I also love the duplicity between Wednesday and her trying-to-be / would-be warewolf roommate, Endid (joyfully played by **Emma Myers**).  There are honestly quite a few very likeable supporting characters that make the gloom and doom (that I love) from the main character and balance it into something even more plateable. \r\n\r\nIf your nostalgic for the kooky family, the show has plenty of fan service that isn't too blatant (at least not for everything all the time). You get the finger snaps, you get Christina Ricci (for those 90's kids fans), and you get a pretty accurate Adams Family as compared to the original source material. \r\n\r\nI believe the plots mystery will keep people engaged enough (it's no Knives Out or Glass Onion), but combine that with the strength of the characters and you get a really great TV show worth re-watching;  which is personally one of the highest praise I can put on a TV series.  Highly recommended!",

Sure, it's got an hungry alligator but the ending is weak, and the characters just parodied everything crass from the tacky late 1970s adult entertainment industry in a really flat, sterile, fashion.

It is so interesting to be so emotionally connected to the killer but yet disturbed by the actions they take as well. I just cannot get over how good this movie is!

              "content": "**By: Louisa Moore / www.ScreenZealots.com**\r\n\r\nTi West is a great visual director, and you can count on his films looking polished and amazing. Such is the case with “X,” the first film in his series of slashers (including the prequel, “Pearl,” and the upcoming “MaXXXine,” which is currently in development). While “X” was released first, I would still recommend watching “Pearl” beforehand. Either order is fine, but I think screening the prequel and keeping the actual story timeline in order makes the most sense if you’re just starting out. “X” features grindhouse style horror that offers an homage to 1970s classics like “The Texas Chainsaw Massacre” but the film also lends a unique, fresh spin on the genre.\r\n\r\nThe year is 1979, and aspiring adult film actress Maxine Minx (Mia Goth) is joined by her cast and crew (Brittany Snow, Kid Cudi, Jenna Ortega, Owen Campbell, and Martin Henderson) to make a different kind of pornographic picture. The group ventures to a remote farmhouse in rural Texas to shoot their film, but something feels “off” about the elderly property owners Howard and Pearl (Stephen Ure and Goth, in a dual role). Their reclusive hosts are unaware of what’s going on out back until they catch the performers in the act. This sets off a chain of very violent events that has everyone fighting for their lives.\r\n\r\nThe retro horror setting serves the story well, even if it has the most basic of plots. What makes this script (penned by West) stand out is the dry humor and interesting, well-written characters that have a lot of depth. It doesn’t take long to start to like and care for these people, which makes their inevitable demise hit a little harder. West’s script includes themes of aging, ambition, voyeurism, and jealousy, all tied together with the joy of setting yourself free from repression. Stifled desire causes the elderly couple to begin their killing spree, but there is so much more underneath the carnage.\r\n\r\nThe film features explicit bloody violence, gore, nudity, and sex, earning its hard “R” rating. West doesn’t turn his camera from the bloodshed even when the audience instinctively looks away. If you aren’t accustomed to horror, this film may not be for you.\r\n\r\nThe cast is comprised of terrific indie actors who trust their director onscreen and off, which shows in their work. Being able to feel so free in front of the camera makes it an easier task to also stand behind it, and all of this results in great entertainment for the audience. The movie is fun and smart, if uncomplicated.\r\n\r\n“X” ends with a wholly satisfying finale and avoids the pitfalls of frustrating the audience, as so many independent horror films seem to do. It’s a slower burn for sure, but what a rewarding ride.",

The film revolves around pornography rather than a cohesive storyline, resulting in a disjointed and atrocious viewing experience. The cinematography, acting, storytelling, and writing were all subpar, yet critics inexplicably praised it.\r\n\r\nThe attempt to elevate the film with Jenna Ortega fell short, as she had minimal screen time amidst excessive male and adult nudity, making it unsuitable for general viewing. This is a movie best watched in private, not recommended by me at all.\r\n\r\nMoving on to \"Pearl,\" I was equally disappointed as it also relied heavily on sexual themes. The film took a bizarre turn, culminating in a scene that made me walk out of the theater in disbelief.\r\n\r\nIt's baffling to see these films receive acclaim, especially when performances like Mia Goth's are lacking. It seems that the current focus is on titillation rather than genuine storytelling.\r\n\r\nAs we await the verdict on the third film, it appears that the world may be more interested in gratification than meaningful narratives.",

              "content": "X by Ti West is definitely a unique take on the slasher genre. The story feels fresh and unlike anything I’ve seen before, making it a solid introduction to something new. The acting by all the characters was good, not perfect, but strong enough to carry the film. It didn’t blow me away, but it worked well with the story.\r\n\r\nThe plot itself is very straightforward and easy to follow, but it takes a bit too long to get going. The first act feels stretched out, with not much happening until later, and it’s a little unclear when the first act transitions into the second. That pacing could’ve been tighter, but once the story picks up, things really start moving, and the payoff is worth it.\r\n\r\nVisually, the film nails the 1970s vibe with gritty yet polished cinematography that draws you in. An interesting choice is the use of the 1.37:1 and the 1.90:1 aspect ratio, which enhances the viewing experience. Overall, it’s a solid horror movie with a unique spin, even if it has its pacing flaws. It’s definitely worth a watch if you’re into stylish, slow-burn horror.",

It's not only an impressively stylish movie, it's an absolutely wild ride from beginning to completion. A fantastic horror slasher, it's brought to life superbly on and 'off' screen.\r\n\r\nMia Goth brings an excellent performance, that one scream fails to escape my memory... co-star Jenna Ortega matches her in that department though, perhaps even surpasses. I've known Goth by name for a while, but this is the first movie of hers that I've logged.\r\n\r\nOrtega herself is very good too, as are all of the others in this 2022 release. Brittany Snow does well, is it just me (probably) that sees a facial resemblance to Christine Lakin? (shoutout anyone who watched <em>'Internet Icon'</em> featuring her back in the day).\r\n\r\nScott Mescudi (aka Kid Cudi, that <i>one</i> shot is a madness btw 😂 *insert Rowley Jefferson gif here*). Martin Henderson, Owen Campbell and Stephen Ure play their part too. The deaths are awesome - super well done. The one with the secondary eye pop edit got me squeamish; the editing is top tier.\r\n\r\nJust looked up the filming locations for this... New Zealand?! I was totally convinced that the farm was the same one used for <em>'The Walking Dead'</em>. Aside from a few differences, the house and barn match my (admittedly fading) memory of Hershel's digs. Clearly not!\r\n\r\nLastly, I did not even realise, until looking at the Wikipedia article in fact, that Goth played Pearl as well... crazy prosthetics! That does make the eponymous follow-up's cover make a lot more sense (given I knew it was a prequel), I was questioning that until this very moment.",

Despite his reluctance; Dewey gets involved and tells Sam the “rules” which would indicate the killer might be someone she knows and soon everyone in her and Tara’s circle becomes suspect even as the deaths start to increase.\r\n\r\nThis allows for some of the best moments of the film as the characters make references to several other modern and past horror franchises and discuss things from online Trolls, rabid fans, and other Pop Culture references which provides some tongue in cheek humor about the series and also establishes the world of “Scream” as one where people are well-versed in horror films old and new and have modified the rules based on sequel, prequel, and “Requel” rules for films.\r\n\r\nAs tensions and body count mounts; Gayle, Dewey, and Sidney (Neve Campbell) must face their fears to stop Ghostface before it is too late.\r\n\r\nWhile the final act of the film is very over the top and at times absurd; it does provide plenty of the elements that fans have come to expect from the series. I was able to accurately see and predict almost all of the twists very early in the film and did not have many surprises as the film unfolded; I think many will still find enough enjoyment watching the tale unfold as after four films I have a pretty good idea of the formula for the series and also have many years of this as I saw the twists in “The Sixth Sense” and “The Village” very early in the films so I just seem to have a knack for this sort of thing.\r\n\r\nWhile it does not break much in the way of new ground; the film does deliver what fans have come to expect and I did find in more enjoyable than “Scream 3” and there was more than enough to keep me entertained. There have been rumors that a sixth film has already been planned and if so: I will be more than ready for more.\r\n\r\n3.5 out of 5",

I couldn't recommend it more.\"\r\n\r\nRating: A-",

              "content": "Ghostface is my favorite cinematic serial killer and I love the first four films (yes, even _Scream 3_ and Gale’s terrible bangs) despite their flaws and fluctuating factors of entertainment. I’ll see and support any new _Scream_ film or TV series that comes along because of it. I know this new installment was successful ($88.4 million worldwide box office gross as of this writing) and some enjoyed it, but it is honestly my least favorite in the franchise.\r\n\r\nThis new film feels like it’s trying too hard to be one of the original _Scream_ films when it should have just been more of its own thing. This is something the film addresses, but originality should always triumph over retreading familiar territory; especially when it seems like its kills are being plunged into the same stab wounds.\r\n\r\nFull review: https://hubpages.com/entertainment/Scream-2022-Review-Movies-Make-Psychos-More-Imitative",

I'd rank this third in the franchise I suppose, behind the original and Scream 2 (for all that movie's flaws, it has a soft spot for me). Not great but worth watching once. **3.25/5**",

It reinvented horror and launched a franchise of sequels of varying quality. And this newest one is the best since the first! It captured all the fun of the first. It kept the stakes high by bringing back the original cast and proving that no one is truly safe. The directors had fun baiting the audience with every slasher trope they could. Tense music would rise every time a character walked past a dark doorway or opened a cabinet to hide the view from the hall - naturally, that is when the killer is standing on the other side but not in Scream! Playing with the tropes in a fun, self-aware way is what Scream is all about, and Matt Bettinelli-Olpin and Tyler Gillett nailed it.",

              "content": "Some things never change. This can be good and also bad. Bad like Audibly Sharp knives (i.e., blades that make a sharpening noise when being whisked through thin air), or like when former deputy Dewey Riley (David Arquette) says “You have to shoot 'em in the head, or they always come back.” Of course, the very existence of the new Scream is irrefutable proof that they will come back regardless. This movie is slasher history repeating itself in more ways than one; in addition to revisiting this particular franchise, it borrows a key plot point from Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare – that I will not reveal but which you may have inkling about if you are, like me, a student of the genre.\r\n\r\nAll of the above notwithstanding, Scream ‘22 is overall more good than bad. True to its roots, this iteration serves as a deconstruction of the current state of mainstream horror cinema. Specifically, it is a textbook example of a “requel” – like the last couple of Halloweens, or the recent Texas Chainsaw Massacre –, and by ‘textbook’ I mean that it actually includes a scene where a character literally explains what a requel is and how it works. I also like that it lampshades one of my least favorite tropes, which I call Chekhov's Inhaler.\r\n\r\nI just compared it to Halloween and The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, but the fact is that Scream ‘22 comes to join the much better company of Wes Craven’s New Nightmare and last year’s Candyman (suitably, the movie is dedicated to Craven’s memory and gives Jordan Peele a shoutout). This Scream’s oft-repeated mantra is “always go back to the original,” and that’s sage advice because, like Nightmare on Elm Street, this franchise is a brainchild of Craven that began life as thinking man’s horror only to get progressively dumbed down with each new entry – unlike, say, Friday the 13th, which was born stupid.\r\n\r\nThankfully, this film has been made by people with knowledge of and respect for their source material, and who don’t underestimate the audience’s intelligence. Consequently, when characters send text messages, the words appear on their phone screens as opposed to our movie and TV screens, and when a someone is stabbed, they spill real fake blood instead of a stream of red pixels (and in an age where CGI is the norm, any horror movie that uses practical effects instantly doubles its visceral impact). I will only add that, also like New Nightmare and Candyman ‘21, Scream ‘22 is as much of a return to form as it is a fitting farewell, so here’s hoping that it will live up to its promise that “After tonight, no more books, no more movies, no more f***ing Ghostface.”",

              "content": "Ignorance brings chaos, not knowledge.\r\n\r\nLucy is one of those films that brings about furious reactions, it is after all a science fiction type action thriller. They always divide film fans right from the off. It's a film that to all intents and purposes needs to be viewed just as a cinematic experience, as a piece of popcorn fodder that may try to be something more cerebral, but ultimately is a daft - but hugely fun - piece of film.\r\n\r\nLuc Besson writes and directs a film that sees Scarlett Johansson duped into being a drug mule, with the transportation of drugs sewn into her abdomen. It's a new drug, boy is it a new drug, and when things go belly up and the drugs are unleashed into Scarlett's system, she's a threat - or hope - to mankind.\r\n\r\nIt can be, and has been, called pretentious et al, such is the science factor, which is perfectly understandable, so any hope of tight science fiction musings will only end up in a crushing disappointment. Undeniably Besson and his backers thought they had something to say, to open up the film watchers' minds to something deep and probable, to be relevant and viable. But unlike the makers we the viewers didn't have access to donepezil, so we sadly couldn't all turn into Bradley Cooper and be limitless in our viewing capabilities.\r\n\r\nPersonally, it's a rollicking fun film for two thirds, when it's about Scarlett kicking butt, a revenge driven babe, it grips and shakes all the genre compliant cinematic senses. The ending, the grand finale, infuriated me, and by the looks of Morgan Freeman (coasting for easy money), he was also a little frustrated. But I had fun, yet on the flip side if anyone fronted me up and said they hated the film with a passion? Then I would understand and take them home to play with my chemistry set. 7/10",

              "content": "A lot of people appears to have gotten into some hate-mode when watching this movie. I guess they did not check up what the movie was really about before watching it. The movie is not perfect, it has its flaws, but a 1 or 2 star bullshit rating is hugely unfair. Personally, I really liked this movie. It is science fiction, pure and simple. If you expect science without the fiction, well then you should go and see some other movie. With Luc Besson both writing and directing and statements like “merciless warrior evolved beyond human logic” in the blurb … well I got pretty much what I expected.\r\n\r\nThe movie starts off making you think it is a “simple” revenge story with science fiction elements in the form of the superhuman Lucy. However it gradually evolves into something else. Lucy knows that she cannot survive in her new state and it becomes a quest to preserve the knowledge that she has acquired while she still has the time and at the same time dodging the drug dealers that are the cause of her situation in the first place.\r\n\r\nLucy is great. Her powers and how they develop are awesome. I really like surprise effects in movies and books of the kind that you get when someone like Lucy reveals her powers to the “mundane”. Especially when the revealing means swatting a few bad guys. This movie is full of moments like that. It is quite a roller coaster ride of action with Lucy exhibiting her growing powers. Not too surprisingly the movie is also full of scientific bullshit and plot holes. I do not really care. I’m in for the ride and it is a fun ride.\r\n\r\nScarlett Johansson is very good in her role as Lucy. Most of the other actors are ok although the Asian drug boss could have been better. He came out more like a brainless thug than anything else. Certainly not as the mastermind of a criminal organization.\r\n\r\nThe ending was a bit unsatisfactory compared to the rest of the movie though. I was a bit disappointed that the big fight at the end more or less was done without Lucy. The long cinematic sequences where Lucy wondered about in time and space felt a bit like yawn-filler-material. The actual ending, well that “I am everywhere” bit was really been there, seen that, done that. Also, if she was indeed everywhere, why the hurry to create that fancy memory stick?\r\n\r\nAnyway, apart from that I really enjoyed this movie.",

              "content": "_**Time to GROW UP**_\r\n\r\n\"Lucy\" (2014) is about an average hot babe named Lucy, played by Scarlett Johansson, who increasingly taps into her mind's full capacity and, consequently, acquires superhuman powers (or are they just fully-human powers?). She hooks up with the leading expert on the human mind (Morgan Freeman) to share her discoveries and also teams-up with a Paris police captain (Amr Waked) to destroy the malevolent schemes of an arrogant Asian mob boss (Min-sik Choi). \r\n\r\nIt should be emphasized that this is not comic book superhero movie (Don't we have enough of those yet?), it's an ordinary-person-reaching-full-human-potential movie. There were two of these in the mid-90s, \"Powder\" (1995) and \"Phenomenon\" (1996). They're both good, but the latter played it too safe, particularly at the end, while \"Powder\" reached for greatness and got a finger in. Francis Ford Coppola added his take on the genre with 2007's \"Youth Without Youth,\" a dense film with many interesting elements; too bad he forgot to include an entertaining story. \r\n\r\n\"Lucy\" is the best of these and is, in fact, one of my all-time favorite movies. \"Lucy\" includes the mindfood of Coppola's film, but doesn't forget to be entertaining. As such, the film mixes interesting, inspiring elements with thrills, action, eye candy and ear candy (a notable score). On top of this, \"Lucy\" is stylish and \"hip,\" whatever that means; in other words, it's got pizzazz.\r\n\r\nSome complain that the film is flawed because it's based on the notion that we only use 10% of our brain power, but this is only a plot device to illustrate that most people are functioning way under their potential and are obsessed with usually worthless things and blowing precious time accordingly. Take, for instance, the people who blow hour upon hour of valuable time watching sports. Viewing a game here or there is great, but these types have lost all sense of moderation. Or how about those who feel they have to numb themselves with alcohol or drugs just to have a good time? They're, in essence, running away from reality. \r\n\r\nWhat's funny about this criticism that the film's based on humans only using 10% of their brain power is that, in most cases, the number's more like 1-2%. Lol, just kidding. (Or am I?) \r\n\r\nIn regards to Lucy's powers illustrated in the film, and the other films noted above, I've had my own run-ins with such phenomena. For instance, about seven years ago I was in bed having an intense dream when my wife burst into the room to wake me up. The smoke alarm outside the door was blaring like crazy, but there was no smoke or fire or heat. The potent energy evoked by my dream obviously set it off because, as soon as I awoke, it suddenly stopped. If there was any doubt, the same thing happened the next week. What can explain this except the untapped power of the mind and focused energy? \r\n\r\nAnother example comes to mind, albeit different: when I was around 8 years old my family and I were walking the trails of Theodore Wirth Park in Minneapolis when we came to the edge of a baseball field. As soon as we entered the outfield somehow I just knew that the current batter was going to hit the ball and it was going to hit me right in the face. I knew this but I didn't know how I knew it. I just knew. Next thing you know the batter hits the ball high into the air -- it was like slow-motion -- and it came and hit me right on the cheek! (Good thing it was a softball, huh?). How did I KNOW this was going to happen? I don't know, but it's pretty amazing and it shows the power of the mind and spirit to warn us, which some call intuition.\r\n\r\nLess spectacular is something that I experience every day with my wife: One of us will be thinking something and give voice to it and the other says, \"I was thinking the exact same thing.\" What's going on? We're picking up each other's immaterial thoughts, otherwise known as telepathy. What if we developed this further? Other paranormal phenomena featured in the story include psychokinesis, extraordinary empathy and what the Bible calls \"the word of knowledge.\" Although they're exaggerated in the film, they're REAL.\r\n\r\n\"Lucy\" is inspiring in that it's an encouragement to GROW UP. As Lucy evolves she stops at her apartment and runs into her roommate, who's the typical bimbo party girl who spends too much of her free time \"partying\" and pursuing a \"cute guy with nice buns\" (or however she puts it). Not that there's anything intrinsically wrong with these things, except that these people obsess over them and they become their PURPOSE for living. Whatever happened to \"All things in moderation\"? The beginning of the movie shows that Lucy was just like her roommate but something happened and... she GREW UP.\r\n\r\nMy praise of the movie's philosophical and theological ideas shouldn't be interpreted to mean that I agree with every jot and tittle. It's a sci-fi/thriller blockbuster, after all; it's just that this one has more interesting ideas than most. Secondly, who agrees with everyone about everything? Is that even healthy?\r\n\r\nNeedless to say, I love \"Lucy\"! \r\n\r\nThe film doesn't wear out its welcome at a mere 1 hour, 29 minutes, and was shot in Taiwan, France and a German airport.\r\n\r\nGRADE: A",

Ok, the philosophy falls short because the script just isn't clever enough but, it's a nice idea. And making the lead a woman was a bold touch. Bring the popcorn but keep a couple of your brain cells awake too.

The film takes place between “Captain America: Civil War” and “Avengers: Infinity War”; audiences get more of the backstory of Natasha Romanoff (Scarlett Johansson), as we are introduced to her early life before the Red Room.\r\n\r\nThis is not to say that the film is an origin story as it uses her backstory through a clever introduction that establishes her “family” as sleeper agents in Ohio before they escape and she and her cover sister are tuned over for conditioning and training.\r\n\r\nSince Natasha is on the run from the authorities; she finds a remote location in Norway to bide her time. This does not last as a dangerous adversary known as the Taskmaster arrives and sets a chain of events into motion.\r\n\r\nNatasha has been sent a package from her cover sister Yelena (Florence Pugh) who also went through the Red Room and became a top assassin in the years since she and Natasha last saw one another.\r\n\r\nDespite her mixed feelings; Natasha ventures to Budapest and confronts Yelena who in turn reveals the package she sent her contains a compound that can free the other Black Widows from the control of the Red Room which despite Natasha’s insistence is still very much alive as is the head of the institute which she is convinced she killed long ago.\r\n\r\nWith Taskmaster and other Widows hot on their trail, Natasha and Yelena are forced to seek the help of their former “Father” the imprisoned hero Red Guardian (David Harbour), and their cover Mother Melina (Rachel Weisz), to find the location of the new Red Room; free the Widows, and end the program once and for all.\r\n\r\nWhat follows is an engaging story with solid action and effects that remains at its core a character story as Natasha attempts to reconcile her cover family with her new Avengers family and the pain of her upbringing and conditioning.\r\n\r\nMarvel resisted calls from some to release the film on Disney+ last year when the Pandemic caused multiple delays to the planned release dates. This decision to me was very wise as this is a film that needs to be seen and heard on the big screen as it is an experience that is best experienced in a cinema with others.\r\n\r\nWhile many attempts were made over the decades to adapt comic heroes to film and television; most of them came up lacking and disappointed fans of the source material. Marvel for over a decade has continued to succeed as they have a clear plan, cast well, and have engaging characters that develop over time.\r\n\r\n“Black Widow” fills in a missing gap of time in the MCU well and also sets up future adventures as a scene in the credits clearly links two of the live-action Disney+ series and shows that the long-term plan for the MCU continues and incorporates the film and television series well.\r\n\r\nFrom the moment the Marvel intro and music appeared on the screen until the very end; “Black Widow” was a very enjoyable and engaging blockbuster adventure that shows Marvel at the top of their game; and why they continue to set event-level movies not to miss.\r\n4 stars out of 5",

Cate Shortland and Eric Pearson put together an MCU installment that doesn't really compare to any of the other origin flicks, profoundly examining the protagonist's dark past and her complex \"family\" through distinctly compelling storytelling. Scarlett Johansson shines one last time, interpreting the most impactful role of her career, but Florence Pugh comes close to stealing the spotlight by giving an absolutely phenomenal display. Boasting highly entertaining, mostly well-filmed action sequences, the main narrative follows a path with no surprises, as well as a generic villain, but the emotionally investing storylines regarding Natasha's personal motivations and Yelena's complex feelings keep the film remarkably captivating. The ending is as satisfying as I could have ever wished for. A loving farewell to a hero that inspired millions of viewers.\"\r\n\r\nRating: A-",

For what it's worth, I actually had to go see Black Widow, ( 'B.W' for short ), -twice- as I wasn't able to catch the beginning the first time around . . & ended up appreciating it -{ So }- much more the second time ; because, being a person with a difficult past myself . . the -Superb- , Intricate, ( and often super - Hilarious 🤣🤣🤣 - ) drama between the lead characters -{ Really }- hit home for me. So much so . . . That inasmuch as ( - I - ) was concerned atleast, just about the -{ Only }- flaw with this film for me, if any, was the altogether \"glaring\" fact that it is now all but -Certain- . . . That we -{ Won't }- see Scarlett Johansson ( 'S.J' for short ) . . . Reprise her fascinatingly complex, and truly \"Glorious\" role as -{ _THE_ }- Black Widow. No spoiler here b.t.w ...this \"Prequel\"-movie's place in the overall 'M.C.U' ( Marvel Cinematic Universe ) timeline has always been made -{ CRYSTAL 💎 }- clear by 'MARVEL STUDIOS'... from the very Get-go. I invite you in earnest, { -Especially- if you're somewhat new to the whole \"M.C.U-thing\" }, to view one particular -Official- trailer by them, the one -still- entitled \"New Trailer\", ( YouTube, Apr.03, 2021 ), where the, 'rationale' ( -if you will- ) for B.W is explained, um, \"Super\"-well . . and is narrated by -none- other than, you guessed it, the \"Hopelessly-Vivacious and yes, genuinely-Affable . .

And it managed to -Achieve- this by essentially showcasing a \"Wide\", ( frankly ), and previously -Unknown- array of intertwined \" Backstories 📚 \" ...( not to mention giving us a satisfyingly -thorough- insight into the smattering of \"badly damaged relationships left in the B.W's wake\" )... that occurred -{ Well before }- & indeed, leading up to, her \"very, very, very\" high-priced and hard-won \"Formal-entry Into Shield\" { and concomitant defection from the Russian Secret Service, the 'F.S.B' ( formerly the 'K.G.B' ) }.

Not only has she very successfully managed to bring together a tremendously -Cohesive- Principal Cast just 'gushing' with absolutely -{ Stellar }- Talent, let's be clear ...( a quick, special \"Mention-of-note\" is altogether warranted here for the -Charmingly- bubbly & ever \"tenacious\" ( newcomer to -MARVEL- ) Florence Pugh, who well & truly excels in her portrayal of 'Yelena Belova' )... but the film-crew that she's \"assembled\" have -{ Also }- well & truly outdone themseves in -Every Single- aspect of the Production . . .

              "content": "Subpar Bond that believes it has emotional stakes isn't exactly a very winning formula. Far too much bad MCU banter to go with something that wants to be grounded and quite frankly none of the actors are quite adapt at those sitcomy whedonisms that these movies made mainstream (Pugh in particular is terrible at those bits). Some of the mid section action is better than average as far as those movies goes but anything with Taskmasker is very bad and the big end is terrible. Winstone villain made me miss when people like Lonsdale and Lee made lousy Moore Bond plots half watchable. The major limitation is that far too much of the emotional beats depend on what characters talk about their time together when they were a pretend family and altough Johansson and Pugh have good chemistry and Weisz and Harbour do as good job as possible under the circunstances of selling their regrets, there just isn't enough downtime between plot needs to anything of it truly land. I can get what Shortland was hoping to import into one of those but little actually works even with the benefit of a far more standalone movie than most of them. Also, strange how after a decade of postponing giving Johansson her movie, they did one in which she so often feels like a witness/connective MCU tissue for the main supporting characters family drama that they had to give her an extra subplot with her guilty over \"killing\" Winstone's daughter so it can feel like she has more material to work with. She is both the lead and the most extraneous part of her own movie",

However, after seeing the deep dives into characters that had been on the sidelines for years, this movie felt very surface level of the complexity of Natasha Romanoff. She was taken as a child to learn how to be an assassin, she had to sacrifice her morals to leave her past behind, she basically remained an assassin for a different organization that turned out to be run by similarly bad people as those she left, and she is now on the run from the government that once hailed her a hero because she didn’t fall in line. Oh, and she is reconnecting with her past fake family that gave her and Yelena back to the Red Room as soon as the mission was over. The trauma this character endured would’ve been better explored as a mini series, rather than a movie that’s trying to simultaneously remind us of where Natasha was five years ago and also trying not to acknowledge that Natasha has no risk posed to her in this movie because we know she lives on past these events. However, very excited to see where Yelena goes in the future.",

              "content": "Black Widow is worth seeing for Florence Pugh, the free-fall action sequence, and anything involving Taskmaster before it’s revealed who is under the mask. Everything else about Black Widow feels like it was done better by the films it was supposedly influenced by and mostly feels like a diluted imitation of Captain America: The Winter Soldier. It’s fantastic that women are getting more opportunities in big summer blockbusters like this one, but it’s also disheartening since their filmmaking skills are shackled to formulaic superfluity that obviously stands in the way of creating extraordinary cinema. \r\n\r\nFull review: https://geekshavegame.com/black-widow-review-espionage-exhaustion/",

              "content": "**Black Widow is a decent MCU film with excellent entertaining characters but an average to disappointing story.**\r\n\r\nBlack Widow faced steep expectations as Marvel's first female-led film focused on a cherished MCU favorite. Black Widow's past was always shrouded in mystery and pain, but she was finally receiving the attention the hero deserved to dive into her past and celebrate Scarlett Johansson's super spy. With hopes high and fans wanting a Captain America: The Winter Soldier-type superhero espionage film, Black Widow, unfortunately, fell short. Nothing was particularly disappointing about the film. I had just hoped for so much more for the character and Scarlett Johansson at this point in the MCU's journey. The effects and action were decent. The villain was forgettable. The big defining Budapest incident was passed by with hardly any impact or emotional weight. Black Widow gets lost in all of the chaos of the film. The best part of the movie by far was the new characters played by Florence Pugh and David Harbor. They were highly entertaining, funny, and endearing. I hope to see Florence Pugh's Yelena Belova in many more Marvel films. Black Widow really was a decent entry in the Marvel universe and one of the better Phase 4 movies. Still, it didn't do Natasha Romanoff the justice she deserved leaving the character's best moments in other Marvel films that focused on other heroes.",

No knowledge of the Avengers is required to watch this film, although, in a Marvel context, it happens after the civil war breaks up the Avengers of which Natasha was a part of. Effects and tension are amazing to watch and edge of seat but there's a payoff with plot. A familiar action film formula – _get and protect the MacGuffin while getting to the evil megalomaniac before he takes over the world_. The formula acts as a vehicle for pretty much non-stop action. If that’s enough for you then this is might be your perfect film.  The familial relationships and confronting her dark past promised in the advert don’t really deliver (although Natasha’s sister, Yelena is essential to this film) but if two hours of Scarlett Johansson kicking high-octane butt is your thing then you’re in for a treat. Too heavy on the action but fun to watch. 6/10",

Der Film zeigt auch, dass das MCU immer und immer wieder mit schwachen Antagonisten zu kämpfen hat, was bei einem Film, der weniger von seiner coolen Action, als vielmehr von seiner Story lebt einfach noch mehr ins Gewicht fällt. Ja, die Actionszenen des Films sind gut. Florence Pugh fügt sich als Schwester von Black Widow gut in das Universum ein und es ist auch schön mehr über die Vorgeschichte von Black Widow zu erfahren. Am Ende muss man allerdings auch sagen, dass Black Widow kein guter Film ist. Dafür überwiegen leider die genannten Schwächen zu sehr und Marvel hat zuletzt mit seinen starken Serien bewiesen, dass sie auch storylastigere Geschichten packend erzählen können. [Sneakfilm.de]",

With that I aside, I went to see it with willingness to give it the benefit of the doubt. \"Ghost in the Shell\" is well...a beautiful shell. \r\n\r\nThe visuals were absolutely breath taking. The action scenes flowed so beautifully with special effects. But that's all the movie had to offer. Take away the spectacles and you have a basic run-of-the-mill action movie. \r\n\r\nThe acting was fine. But honestly, the leads didn't have anything to actually sink their teeth into. Scarjo, and everyone else, was serviceable. \r\n\r\nIf you're looking for some mindless, yet stunning entertainment, then go see it.",

              "content": "I've watched Ghost in the Shell at the cinema 3 days ago, knowing\r\nbeforehand about the controversies that have surrounded this movie for\r\nthe last 6 months or so. Science fiction movies are probably my\r\nfavorite genre and I also enjoyed most of Scarlett's movies for the\r\npast 8-9 years so those two factors were a plus for me going in. \r\n\r\nRegarding the whitewashing business, I think its been blown way, WAY\r\nout of proportion by social justice warriors with nothing better to do\r\nthan drag media attention over whatever they're feeling insecure about\r\nthis month/year. For those of you who might be on the fence about\r\nwatching a Caucasian actress in the role that (supposedly) should've\r\nbeen reserved to an Asian actress, please consider this a NON-MATTER\r\nand watch it anyway. The character she is portraying is SUPPOSED to\r\nlook Caucasian/white. It was the same in the source material and even\r\nthe creator of that anime said so in interviews.\r\n\r\nNow, is the movie any good? In my opinion, yes. Yes it was. It wasn't\r\namazing but at the very least entertaining. There is a good amount of\r\npeople who score this a 1/10 because they are butt hurt that the story\r\nwas changed a lot. Please ignore them and see for yourself even if\r\nyou're a fan of the anime and are able to keep an open mind. I think\r\nmaybe I was able to judge it more objectively because I had zero\r\nknowledge about the story in the anime going in, but, if nothing else,\r\nthe movie actually made me want to watch those old ones to compare.\r\n\r\nThe acting - 7.5/10 - Since Scarlett Johansson is the only big name\r\nthat the movie is being marketed alongside, I'd say she did a good job.\r\nAt no point in the movie could I say she didn't belong there. She\r\nplayed the part of cyborg who had difficulty belonging in a human world\r\nvery well. The cast is diverse enough in my opinion, though some of\r\nthem get pretty little screen time.\r\n\r\nThe visuals - 9/10 - If there is one point most critics/viewers are in\r\nalignment concerning this movie, that point is definitely the visuals.\r\nThe movie both looks and feels spectacular, with the futuristic city\r\nlooking like a close-future mix of Blade Runner and TRON. The\r\ncombination of CGI and practical effects looks organic, the movie's\r\npowerful themes of excessive self-augmentation and technology almost\r\nrunning amok represented very well visually.\r\n\r\nSoundtrack - 8/10 - Sometimes pretty subdued, sometimes\r\nalmost-but-not-quite in your face, I found the soundtrack to vary\r\nbetween decent and very good in some moments. It didn't MAKE the movie\r\nbut it enhanced a good deal in my opinion.\r\n\r\nStory - 7/10 - Here is where the good points of the movie kinda start\r\nto run dry. A lot of other people would probably rate it a lot lower,\r\nwith 5 or 4's if they're at least trying to be objective. Yes, the\r\nstory is fairly predictable, and the fact that the movie is only around\r\n100 minutes long doesn't do it any favors either. Here is probably\r\nwhere most of the legitimate hate towards this movie stems from. The\r\ncreators adapted a story that had a lot more depth and philosophical\r\ninsight and turned it into a somewhat generic cyborg coming of age\r\nstory mixed with an evil corporation doing questionable things. The\r\nvillain is also very cookie-cutter and has almost zero depth. HOWEVER,\r\nI do think that concerning this film's particular themes and narrative,\r\na weak villain doesn't hurt it so much since its more about\r\nlosing/gaining your humanity through technology than any bad guy trying\r\nto shoot you.\r\n\r\nWriting/Dialogue - 6/10 - By far the movie's weakest aspect. In fact, I\r\nbelieve if some more meaningful dialogue and character interactions\r\nwere written into this film, it could've easily been 1 or 2 points\r\nhigher on anyone's scoring system. As it is, the dialogue is shallow\r\nand fairly run-of-the-mill for about half the movie's length. Some bits\r\nof good interactions are sprinkled here and there, and thankfully\r\nthat's enough to preserve the soul of the movie's central theme of\r\nhuman souls surviving in machine bodies, BUT not enough to give Ghost\r\nin the Shell the depth it should've inherited from the source material.\r\n\r\nOverall - I gave this movie 3.5/5 stars here, mostly because I\r\ncouldn't give it a 7.5/10 which felt more appropriate to me. My advice\r\nwould be to not listen to the whitewashing nonsense, because that's\r\nexactly what it is, nonsense. Also don't listen to the haters who rate\r\nthis movie a 1/10 or call it shit because those people should not be\r\nreviewing anything to begin with. It is a decent movie, with great\r\nvisuals and a theme that might get you thinking for a couple of days\r\nafter seeing it. The acting is decent, with an above average\r\nperformance from Scarlett and a good soundtrack that might hit the\r\nright spot on occasion. The only bad aspects, like I mentioned, are the\r\nfilm's rather short running time and weak dialogue/writing which hold\r\nit back from being truly great.",

The movie succeeds in displaying the setting and overall feel of the area. Everything is a grainy, low-tech with abundant neon and cyber-solidified humans. Sadly, the script is a bit of a mess. Kusanagi becomes Major Mira Killian (you'll see why toward the end the film) and Scarlett Johhansson, generally a quite credible actress, is sort of wasted here.\r\n\r\nWe do not get a lot of character development for her or her crewmates. There aren't a lot of quirky, funny moments as there are in the animated versions. Worse still, a lot of the teaser from the movie are just absent here, and one feels cheated. Overall this is a fine bit of popcorn absorption but fails to live up the series's standards and fails to give any of the actors much to work with. See it on a rainy day, if nothing else.\r\n\r\n3.5/5",

I'm sure glad I didn't waste my money for that and only spent $1.62 to rent it from RedBox.\r\nThe trailer didn't show much, which is good.  I hate trailers that give away everything about a movie.  \r\nSo, a hot girl is always good...   \r\nAnd it had the teaser nudity that isn't real but is a suit - I'll let you be the judge of that.\r\nThe rest is the same old overused nonsense from all other science fiction movies:\r\nA lot of fighting, shooting, explosions and destruction - way too much of that... but just about all sci-fi and superhero movies these days only contain that.\r\nThe first hour was incredibly boring.  After about 70 minutes, it got just slightly interesting and then all the fighting/shooting/destruction began.  There is nothing interesting about that - we've all see that hundreds of times. It's ridiculous.\r\nWhy can't any of these shooters hit anything?  We still have that.  It isn't interesting to watch.  Thousands of rounds flying and everyone missing their target.  With all this high tech stuff, why don't they have more advanced weapons?\r\nI have to say, I was in Arizona earlier this year and fired a handgun for the very first time.  It was a 6-shooter, a Colt \"Peacemaker\", you know the pistol of the \"West\".  You don't \"AIM\" those, you lift them to just above waist high, look at your target & not the gun, and pull the trigger. After just a few shots, it starts to become very natural. Any sane person can hit a target the size of a person at least somewhere on their body, even if they are moving.  24 rounds: I had 24 hits & 0 misses at various distances. But the people in these movies can't hit anything even when they do aim and with much better weapons.  \r\nAnd then you have Major, her manufactured body can stretch & tear, wires breaking, and it can still function?  Uh, NO, it wouldn't.  That's not how mechanics and electronics work.\r\nThe City: a ridiculous \"Blade Runner\"/\"Fifth Element\" type of city but with fish floating around.  No, not interesting at all. Just very silly.\r\nOh, one petty but very annoying thing: They can build an entire body and install a human brain in it and get everything to work but they can only give her a ragged, jagged wig or haircut?  That's very weird.  Her crooked bangs were a distraction in every scene that included her facing the viewer.\r\n\r\nIn Summary: This movie has a lot of awesome CGI with a ridiculous plot and horrible acting.  Great CGI alone doesn't make a great, or even a good, movie.  This catastrophe is a perfect example of that.",

              "content": "This is an okay movie but that is about it. The blurb sounded quite interesting and the trailers were promising even though I always take trailers with a huge pinch of salt. I have never read the original Manga. Whether that is good or bad with respect to the movie I do not know.\r\n\r\nThe good stuff as far as this movie is concerned is, not surprisingly, the visuals. I would not say that they are stunning but the are quite good. The environments are interesting and the special effects are not bad at all. I have to say that the tank design was pretty poor though. Not very exiting as a fictional design and utter nonsense from a functional point of view.\r\n\r\nThis is as far as the good stuff goes. The story is okay but it is pretty predictable and not that much to get exited about. It could have been more developed for sure. I would actually have liked to see the Major do a few more missions beating up the bad guys. That was where the movie shined a bit and showed the best visuals and special effects.\r\n\r\nThe acting is pretty mediocre to be honest. Even Daisuke Aramaki, which was a character that I did like, felt rather bland. The main bad guy was just a uninspiring thug.\r\n\r\nTo me the movie more or less felt like the pilote episode of a TV-show with a huge budget for visuals. It was not WOW god but showed promise and I felt like I would like to see more “episodes”. The fact that it is actually a movie and it seems unlikely that a sequel, even though the ending makes it pretty clear that they hoped there would be one, will be made left me with a unsatisfied feeling.\r\n\r\nBottom line, average movie with enjoyable visuals and special effects but one which do not manage to reach above the “just another sci-fi manga movie” segment for me.",

The film was fine, but that does not mean so good. From the visuals to the performances, it sounded great. But the story wasn't. When the original concept was created nearly 30 years back, it fascinated people for being something new and powerful. But for the current world, for the current generation, it is just an ordinary sci-fi. All I say is it just came out at least 15 years late. So the 90s kids would have loved it!\r\n\r\nThe storyline was nothing, but a self-discovery of a half human, half machine. This has been the plot of hundreds of robot films. But it's just differently told. One of only kind, a human brain was saved after the severe accident and given an artificial body. Now she's known as Major fights the crime. But some day later, she's haunted by glitches in her vision which directly connected to her past that she does not remember. The rest of the film was finding the truth and other consequences, before it all ends.\r\n\r\nVisual effects were the only advantage for this film to come out in the present era. The rest of the film was simply okayish. I don't know what the original source fans say about it, but it is a one time watchable film. Otherwise, there are plenty of similar good films, like this is nothing much different than 'Robocop'. Or the recent TV series 'Westworld'. Scarlett Johansson could become a reason for some people to peek into it. The writing and direction were average. Watch and forget kind of film.\r\n\r\n_5/10_",

And, hey, what if Keanu Reeves was their Messiah?\r\n\r\nWhat sounds like some web freak's wet dream is, in fact, a dazzlingly nifty slice of sci-fi cool. The Wachowski Brothers (Andy and Larry - last seen dabbling in kinky lesbian noir with the excellent Bound) pulling off something like a million masterstrokes all at once. Taking the imprimatur of the video game, they meld the grungy noir of Blade Runner, the hyperkinetic energies of chopsocky, John Woo hardware and grandiose spiritual overtones into William Gibson's cyberpunk ethos to produce a new aesthetic for the millennium powered to the thudding beat of techno. And it is just incredible fun. The key is the technique of \"flo-mo\", a process born from Japanese animation, whereby an object in motion is seemingly frozen while the camera miraculously spins around it as if time and gravity are on hold. It grants the action (including some killer kung fu which Reeves and crew spent months perfecting) liberty to take on surreal visual highs. Superhuman feats permissible, of course, in the context of VR as the rebels download Herculean \"talents\" to fuel their subterfuge. Meanwhile, the audience can only gawp longingly, with its jaws thunking to the cinema floor in unison, as the heroes wrapped in skintight leather, sleek shades and designer cheekbones, spin up walls, leap from high rises and slip through streams of bullets in silken slo-mo. Tron this ain't.\r\n\r\nImmediately reigniting the moribund cyberpunk genre (the kids can't get enough Stateside), this has thrust Reeves from his imploding career back to Speed highs (and laying to rest the hideous ghost of Johnny Mnemonic) and stolen much more of Star Wars' thunder than was thought humanly possible. For all its loony plot, The Matrix is fabulous.\r\n\r\nSure, the expert Fishburne is depended upon to expound the lion's share of the script as seer-like rebel leader Morpheus. Reeves, stunning in his newcast slenderness, as Thomas \"Neo\" Anderson, the hacker turned hope for all mankind (care of some ill-defined mystical calling) is asked little more than perpetual befuddlement. Like Speed, though, this movie plays on his iconic looks rather than his oak-like emoting. There's a major find, too, in the irresistible Carrie-Anne Moss, a majestically wrought combination of steely no-shit intelligence and rock-chick vivaciousness as fellow tripper Trinity. And Weaving, cast against type, neutralises his Aussie tones to a freaky deadpan, the head of the MiB-styled defence system set against the Goth invaders.\r\n\r\nAnd sure, three minutes of post-movie deliberation and all this state-of-the-art cyberdevilry is reduced to the purest gobbledygook. That, though, is not the point. The Matrix is about pure experience; it's been many a moon since the Empire crew have spilled out of a cinema literally buzzing with the sensation of a movie, babbling frenetically with the sheer excitement of discovery.\r\n\r\nFrom head to tail, the deliciously inventive Wachowskis (watch them skyrocket) have delivered the syntax for a new kind of movie: technically mind-blowing, style merged perfectly with content and just so damn cool, the usher will have to drag you kicking and screaming back into reality. You can bet your bottom dollar George never saw this phantom menace coming.\r\n\r\n\r\nVerdict - The deliciously inventive Wachowskis have delivered the syntax for a new kind of movie: technically mind-blowing, style merged perfectly with content and just so damn cool.\r\n\r\n5/5\r\n\r\n- Ian Nathan, Empire Magazine",

But he has to escape the “agents” who are pursuing him (e.g. Hugo Weaving) to get to Morpheus. At which point his world is turned upside down and inside out. Marcus Chong and Joe Pantoliano are also on hand.\r\n\r\n\"The Matrix\" (1999) is a cerebral sci-fi/action film that mixes elements of the first two Terminator flicks (1984/1991) with martial arts action and a basic concept that hails back to “Star Trek: The Motion Picture” (1979) and no doubt further.\r\n\r\nTo put this intricate movie together and make it entertaining took genius, so I give credit to the Waschowski Brothers, um, I mean sisters (rolling my eyes). The casting is great and Carrie-Anne is stunning throughout (I usually don’t like short hair on women, but she’s an exception). For me, though, the Waschowskis made it too comic booky. The posturing characters in their slick black outfits & sunglasses scream “Yeah, right.” And the Messiah angle is old hat.\r\n\r\nThe film runs 2 hours, 16 minutes, and was shot in Sydney, Australia, with some exterior scenes done in Nashville and San Francisco.\r\n\r\nGRADE: B",

His latter persona is constantly challenging his norms, his behaviour, his reality even - and when he is contacted by Carrie-Anne Moss \"Trinity\" his suspicions begin to pan out and he is introduced to a crew of rebels led by \"Morpheus\" (Laurence Fishburne) on a mission to expose the extent to which mankind is merely a plaything of the \"Matrix\" living entirely imagined lives. The system is onto them, though, and using Hugo Weaving's \"Agent Smith\" and a fifth columnist from within the group's own ranks, is bent on their destruction. This film has that scarce value of having exciting (rather than delicately choreographed) action scenes married together with an intelligent, at times quite thought-provoking dialogue mixing fact/fiction and religiosity on a clever premiss that once we start to question reality; the conspiracy theories can run wild - and right to the top! Is \"Neo\" the one to save humanity - some sort of resurrected \"one\"? The Wachowski Brother remind us how to make a good sci-fi fantasy, but also that in his day Keanu Reeves was a one of the best, his boy-next-door good looks, agility and charisma working very well here. Of course the effects have dated, but one you've been subsumed into the plot - and if you are watching on a big screen - then that matters not; it's a gripping chunk of cinema depicting loyalty, determination and integrity that I really enjoyed.",

              "content": "This is very much my kind of movie. Straightforward, lots of good action, our hero never waivers from his path and no social or emotional nonsense. Those who have watched the movie might wonder why I claim that there is not emotional nonsense since the entire plot is driven by John Wick’s very emotional response to his wife’s death and the subsequent killing of the dog that he received as a last present from her. What I mean with “no emotional nonsense” is that John Wick is never second guessing himself, the movie never really tries to portray him as an “ordinary” guy having second thoughts about killing the bad guys and he doesn’t go into some silly “oh should I really pull the trigger” trance and drops the gun in the worst possible moments as is done in a lot of movies. Sure, there are emotions in this movie. Rage and thirst for revenge in particular with the addition of a healthy dose of fear from the bad guys…eventually that is.\r\n\r\nThe plot of the movie is, as I wrote, quite straightforward and classical. Retired hit man gets wronged by idiot son of big bad guy. Hit man gets pissed off and goes on a quest for revenge. People die (a lot of them). Hit man and big bad guy have a show down at the end. In terms of story that is about it. However, such a story can be told and presented in a good and entertaining way and in a less good and entertaining way. As far as I am concerned the way the story is told in this movie is very, very entertaining.\r\n\r\nKeanu Reeves is quite good as the hit man. So are the big bad guy and most of the other actors of any importance. During the course of the movie we get more than a few glimpses into John Wick’s former life and it is a quite cool background that have been elaborated. The secret world that John Wick was once part of and how it works and operates would be worthy a good old-fashioned James Bond movie.\r\n\r\nThen of course there is the action. It is an action movie so you do expect quite some expenditure on the action and this movie do not disappoint. There are lots of action and it is good action. Sure, the ease by which John Wick picks off his opponents waiving his gun(s) in all direction without hardly looking is sometimes a bit over the top but it is still done with a fluidness and grace that just makes it … so cool. The gun fights are generally mixed up with some equally good martial arts close combat stuff and it is really well woven together.\r\n\r\nOne thing that I really like with this movie is that John Wick is the cool, cold, determined, not to be pissed off, killing machine from start to finish. There are really no slow parts or “obligatory” scenes of doubt and self-recrimination. It is “the bad guys will pay” all the way. This of course gives the opportunity to include some other elements that I quite like in a story like this. For instance the parts where the spoiled total idiot son of the big bad guy slowly gets his arrogance replaced by some good, honest to God, fear. Fear of death and fear of the guy he so carelessly pissed off.\r\n\r\nNeedless to say, I enjoyed this movie a lot when I sat down to watch it with my oldest son yesterday.",

Carnage ensues.\r\n\r\nThe paying public do like a good revenge flick, there have been plenty this last couple of decades, and they do go down well. Once the set-up has been staged - Wick grieves at the loss of his loved one - gets some small joy via a pet - only to have that snatched away from him, then the film becomes a joyously unstoppable actioner.\r\n\r\nWick, in good hands with a moody and beefy Reeves (face fuzz strange, though) strong in presence, cuts a swathe through the gangland eastern blockers. And that's pretty much it! Characterisations are thin on the ground, it's a bit nutty and of course preposterous, but boy is it fun. There you go, a box office winning actioner without pretensions.

As far as the plot goes, its pretty simple but there is a lot of depth to the world.\r\n\r\nReeves displays a decent amount of acting range here, but his real talent is bringing bad guys down one headshot at a time. Its glorious to see him smack a guy over the head, hold him down while reloading, and then take him out.\r\n\r\nThe best thing about this film is the lack of shaky cam-- you can see all the action happening clearly. This is made possible by the dedication of the actors in their martial arts training.\r\n\r\nSupport films like this, they are a rare breed these days!",

And whoever isn't terrified doesn't mean that they're better, it just means that they don't know JOHN WICK.\r\n\r\nIt definitely isn't the first character of it's kind, but very few characters of this kind convince you that they are what they are supposed to be. Let's just say that John Wick kicks a** and he is pretty awesome at that.\r\n\r\nI can't think of anyone else to be John Wick other than Keanu Reeves, the guy's living the character on screen. The hand to hand combat, usage of knives and guns, the action, it all seems poetic at times. The thing I loved the most is that there wasn't too much noise, no Boom Boom, just the Bang Bang, exactly what you'd expect from a hit-man.\r\n\r\nThe cinematography, dialogues, background score, direction, action, everything was just what a movie like this needs. It ticked all the right boxes for me and I think every action movie fan would lap this one up.\r\n\r\nIt is a great action revenge movie that never runs out of steam throughout it's course. So, everyone who loves to see bullets flying all over the screen, or to quote it better, say hitting just the right spots, go treat yourself to this movie. You'd be glad.\r\n\r\nAn 8 out of 10",

It's also stylish, high energy, and generally just a fun popcorn movie.\r\n\r\n\"John Wick\" is a retired hitman who gets brought back into the life by a personal attack (no spoilers here, but if you're squeamish about animal cruelty, be warned). Okay, we've heard this story dozens of times.\r\n\r\nWhat's different is the world in which this takes place. There's a secret criminal underground that seems to have their hands in everything, and there's a specific code and honor among thieves. Actually, come to think of it, we never really meet anyone who isn't involved or in the know somehow, so it's implied that this society is very widespread and possibly runs everything. This film actually seems to have more in common with the \"Wanted\" comic book than the \"Wanted\" movie did.\r\n\r\nPart of the style and identification with the near superhuman Keanu Reeves as Wick is that he isn't a perfect action hero. He gets hurt. A lot. Unlike Neo, he's not invincible. He's simply very well trained and determined, which makes the combat sequences more interesting because, even though you know the outcome, there's always this little part in the back of your mind that wonders if he'll come out in one piece, making them gritty and...semi-realistic. Let's be honest, a lot of the action moves are very theatrical and wouldn't have much practical value in the real world.\r\n\r\nGiven the implications for how big this criminal underworld probably is, it seems to have been set up to be a franchise from the start. From background characters like Ian McShane's Winston (who keeps referring to Wick as \"Jonathan\" even though the name is John; different spelling means it isn't a shortened version of his name) to Lance Reddick's hotel manager (who I would swear there is more going on with this character and hopefully gets explored later), there's a lot of ground to explore. It's not a smart or challenging film, but it is fun and not a bad way to spend a couple hours if you like action movies.",

Chad Stahelski and team break free from the now overused shaky cam to hide mediocre acting and push their stars and stunt team to give us some of the best action sequences in film since The Matrix. But to take this movie even further into brilliance, Stahelski prefers to show and not tell the audience about the world in which John Wick lives. As a result, everything is mysterious, leaving viewers intrigued, questioning, and wholly immersed in this assassin-filled world. The unusual gold coin currency, the legend and fear of John Wick, the enigmatic Continental hotel that forbids any assassin \"work\" on the premises, and much more sweeten a typical action revenge story into a cinematic treasure.",

While the story and performances are lacking, the creators make attempts at establishing a greater world around the characters. There are some really creative services and lore that go into the assassin underworld that is simply brilliant. The acting all around is quite lackluster. I love Keanu Reeves as a man, but he cannot deliver dialogue well. I know he is supposed to be very emotionless, but there is just a robotic nature to his line delivery that is quite awkward. His performance does not take a ton away from the movie but could have elevated it if he were a bit better. The main conflict of the story is a bit cheesy and did not totally work for me, but at the end of the day, it is just a vehicle for the action and does enough to propel the story forward. The main focus of these films is the brutality of the choreography. John Wick stacks up a large body count with ease executing opposing assassins with a plethora of weapons and tactics. There are some creative kills in the movie, but most are just headshots delivered by a pistol. I would have loved to see a little bit more variety, but it was so in-your-face and absurd that I still had a great time with it.\r\n\r\nScore: 79%\r\nVerdict: Great",

His character is a badass, that's for sure.

What is clear to arch-villain “Viggo” (Michael Nyqvist), though, is that his hot-headed son (Alfie Allen) has gone and stirred up one hell of an hornet’s nest. To try to save his son from what would appear to be certain death, he tries to enlist the help of assassin “Marcus” (Willem Dafoe) but “Wick” is armed with an whole array of weaponry and some invaluable gold coins that suggest he is part of an international network that has rules! Woe-betides anyone who crosses them, or their enforcer “Winston” (Ian McShane). It’s end-to-end stuff, this, with loads of brutal action right from the start. Reeves does regurgitate his “Neo” role from “The Matrix” (1999) a little but here the stunt choreography is nowhere near as repetitive and the cat and mouse dynamic excites more naturally than some more video-game style of adventures where the scenarios play, reset and repeat all too often. Reeves hasn’t much by way of meaningful dialogue to worry about as the action elements unfold, he just needs to be as useful with a surgical needle as he is with guns, knives and trashed furniture. It does rather rush things at the end, with a few significant sub-plots terminated unimaginatively, but this is still a solid and entertaining revenge thriller that gets the mix of mayhem and carnage just about right.",

              "content": "~NO SPOILERS~\r\n\r\nThis movie essentially starts right after the first one ends, right at the top-down view of New York City. Dark humor abounds,\r\nbullets rip through head and bodies, and Wick is unstoppable.\r\n\r\nThis film should be held as the gold standard for action movies. There is very little camera shake during fights and Reeves clearly has spent a lot of time preparing for this role. You can see nearly every take-down, every gunshot, and Wick has to reload at inconvenient times in a realistic fashion which also adds to the hilarity of the following kills.\r\n\r\nOverall the acting performances were solid. Reeves isn't known for having an extremely wide range, but his devotion to making this movie a kick-ass martial arts production is second to none. I felt the villain was a bit on the weak side though, but he did his role justice. Ian McShane's character remains the strongest especially combined with the last film.\r\n\r\nThe lighting is superb! There's a red-blue theme that is in nearly every nightclub and darkly lit areas and its absolutely lovely to look at. Overall cinematography is very good.\r\n\r\nDefinitely worth seeing!",

              "content": "I was really hoping I would like this movie. I so enjoyed the first one. However, when the credits started to roll at the end I found myself wondering “What the fuck happened?”.\r\n\r\nBe warned that the rest of this review might contain a spoiler or two.\r\n\r\nOne thing I really liked about the first movie was, as you can read in my review about that one,  that it was a no bullshit, kill the bad guys and no emotional regrets, kind of movie. John Wick went all out for revenge and at the same time we got introduced into this cool world of assassins, safe havens, hidden “shops” for guns, classy tailors providing bullet proof costumes etc. etc.\r\n\r\nIn this movie he is forced onto a job by a real asshole. He is constantly reluctant and walks around with a sad puppy face all the time. Of course said asshole screws him halfway through the movie and that would have been a good time to start get back on track with some decent payback story but unfortunately the script writers thought otherwise. After some more of the same shit no one really wins in the end (although one of the two adversaries suffer a more “permanent” setback than the other).\r\n\r\nWorse is that, in my opinion, in their eager to put together some crap drama this movie essentially screwed up the possibilities for a John Wick 3 unless they pull some rather big surprise rabbit out of the hat for that one.\r\n\r\nThere are plenty of action in the movie of course but also her I feel that it was a bit too over the top. No one, absolutely no one, seems to be able to shoot straight except for John Wick. This makes the action feel more like a parody a’la Kill Bill than a more serious action, revenge movie. Yes it is cool to watch but only up to a point. Heck, if this would have been a Star Trek (TOS) episode Hollywood’s entire supply of red shirts would have been used up on a single movie. While I am bitching I should perhaps also mention that the amount of beating that John Wick seems to be able to absorb is … unbelievable.\r\n\r\nI did enjoy the movie but not at all as much as I hoped I would. To me it has a completely different spirit than what I remember from the first one and the ending is, again to me at least, not a happy one.\r\n\r\nHaving said that the action sequences are as cool, crazy but cool, and violent as they are unbelievable. I found it a bit sad that they wrecked his nice car though.\r\n\r\nOverall a enjoyable movie but no match for the first chapter and I cannot bring myself to give it more than 3 out of 5 stars.",

              "content": "**All eyes on him and all guns pointed at him.**\r\n\r\nIt was not an attracting title for a sequel. The first film was good, completely an unexpected, but I was expecting this one, even though not as much as I was excited to see 'Jack Reacher 2'. That film was good, but did not meet with its first film's merit. And this sequel, really amazing. One of best follow-up flick and better than the original. That feat considered very rare in cinema and here is the one.\r\n\r\nEntirely different than the first. I meant the storyline. A new action, a new adventure, and even on a bigger scale. Though the initial parts were average. I totally disliked that killing assignment Mr. Wick took in his hand, but what followed after made the film great, definitely not to be missed for that alone. Especially if you are an ardent action film fan. For me, that reminded me 'Kill Bill', but they are not the same kind, except the fighting concept with hundreds.\r\n\r\nContinued from a couple of days later where the previous narration had ended. Now the retired assassin, John Wick forced to take a final job, but soon he finds he was backstabbed. Every eye on the town on him and every gun pointing at him, there's no way he could get out of it easily. So, he has to fight them all, just in order to survive. Then what comes later are even more aggressive screenplay that's ends with left open the door for the third film.\r\n\r\nNow this became a stylish franchise. That's what happens when a stuntman takes up the directional job for an action flick. He did not write it, but he knew exactly how to create them, technically perfectly. Besides, he got wonderful, dedicated actors to achieve that. Not just Reeves, but all were awesome. Believe the third film would be a kick-ass, particularly the pace that could match with likes 'Crank'. Just watch it already and be prepared for the next, the mega finale.\r\n\r\n_8/10_",

              "content": "Picking almost right where the previous film ended, \"John Wick Chapter 2\" deals with the consequences of Wick's return to the assassin life and how he got out to begin with.\r\n\r\nAs expected, it expands on the mythology hinted at in the first movie, with the revelation that there's a high council of sorts, other Continental hotels around the world, and a very widespread network of assassins.\r\n\r\nAlso as expected, it ups the ante with bigger action sequences, and a much higher body count. We get to know more about some rival assassins played quite brilliantly by Common and Ruby Rose (whose character communicates solely through sign language; in many cases, this kind of thing is used as a gimmick to make the audience remember a character when they have nothing else to distinguish them, but it's not the case here  and is used only as an aspect of the character; smartly done). Keanu Reeves...let's the Reeves of old come through a couple times, with a couple of bizarre and inappropriate inflections. Ian McShane's Winston expands a little bit, although he still refers to John as Jonathan, which is just wrong. If it's supposed to be some kind of an in-joke with them, they don't reveal anything about it. Again, I think there's more going on with Lance Reddick's hotel manager than they're letting on. And I was a little disappointed that Peter Stormare wasn't in more of the film, as he's always fun.\r\n\r\nAgain, the world is very wide, and almost seems like everyone is involved with this underworld. There is an indication that that's not the case here and there, but we never get to meet anyone who doesn't know what's going on, which keeps some of that suspicion up.\r\n\r\nThe plot follows a pretty basic structure. Actually, it follows a pretty rigid structure. In a two hour movie, it can be broken down almost exactly into half-hour sequences, something that struck me as a little odd. There are some minor plot twist. Nothing major or out of the blue, but at least there was an attempt.\r\n\r\nSo now we come down to it. Is it better or worse than the first movie? Well, I would have to say \"yes\". It definitely ups the ante and is a much bigger film than the first movie, expanding on the mythology and the characters. At the same time, it falls into the trap that a lot of these bigger, badder sequels fall into, which is that with the bigger scope, it feels like they have to use a bigger yoke on everything in order to keep in reined in and from going off the rails on its own. In fact, they may have expanded the world too quickly, going from a city in the first movie to the entire globe in the second. That rapid expansion makes that bigger yoke much more percpetible and, while the ambition is admirable, at times I wondered if they may have bitten off more than they could chew.\r\n\r\nStill an enjoyable action film, and if you liked the first film, you'll most likely enjoy this one.",

The sequel takes every aspect of the first and expands on it, making it bigger and better, but still having the same drawbacks of the first. The story and performances are not the greatest, but do enough to drive the action and film forward. I would argue that the plot here is slightly improved due to the larger scope. The assassin underworld is expanded as we get to see more subsects and players in the space. There are complex relationships that Wick has with many characters in this film, and although we never see what occurred in the past, the history is there in terms of their interactions. This is especially apparent in the end when all of Wick’s former “co-workers” start entering into the fold. This had to be my favorite part of the film. Rome, as a setting, was great and the underground tunnels were a fun environment for Wick to play in. The action was brilliant once again, with more weapons and creative kills included. I loved that we got to see Wick use the pencil on two of the guards! There were some beautiful shots with fantastic color due to the city light scape. The use of water reflections was done well, although, I do think there might have been a few too many. The pace towards the end started to slow down. I feel as though this movie should have been maybe 10-15 minutes shorter. Despite that, this movie was once again a fantastic entry into the series and on par with the first in terms of quality, action, and enjoyment. \r\n\r\nScore: 79%\r\nVerdict: Great",

He has to travel to Rome where he is soon subsumed in a web of secret societies all wanting him on a slab. Add to this perilous mix the truly wooden talents of Ian McShane (\"Winston\") and after countless extended, hugely artistic and choreographed fight scenes I was heading for the arms of Morpheus. It's just dull! Well produced, yes. Good looking - yes. Stylish - yes. Sadly, though - the repetitive nature of the action scenes and the wafer thin plot leaves no jeopardy whatsoever and it's so obvious that there are more of these to come that it doesn't matter how precarious his predicament, you just know he will survive - even if the beating he takes would kill a rhino! Lawrence Fishburne adds a little bit of panache as the \"Bowery King\" but otherwise, sorry - I'm clearly not the demographic!",

After (what looked like) a platonic one night stand, \"Bea\" (Sydney Sweeney) and \"Ben\" (Glen Powell) manage to part company loathing one another. Serendipity has no intention of allowing this to be the end of things though, and so arranges for her sister to marry one of his best friends. After a few uncomfortable meetings in a bar, they all head off to Australia for the nuptials. Her parents are very keen to get her back with ex \"Jonathan\" (Darren Barnet) whilst his ex \"Margaret\" (Charlee Fraser) is also there. Against their better judgment our two decide to pretend to be a couple to provoke envy from one and protect the other from the intent of the meddling parents. What now ensues does really depend on a plausible degree of chemistry between Sweeney and Powell and I thought they did quite well. A little bit more meddling from Bryan Brown, some Di Caprio-esque action at the front of a yacht and some kindly support from the Sydney harbour rescue helicopter helps keep this amiably jogging along for an admittedly twenty minutes too long 1¾ hours. It's quite pithily written and manages to avoid the worst in both American and Australian stereotypes. It also isn't shy of sex, comic nudity and a bit of practical adult humour that makes a change from the usual puerile smut we are so frequently offered nowadays. It's entirely forgettable, but is an enjoyable enough dollop of sun, sea, sex and silliness.",

It does do clichés, but does at least add some freshness to the genre.\r\n\r\nSydney Sweeney and Glen Powell portray great chemistry, I enjoyed both performances. Sweeney's stylist killed it I gotta say, heck even Powell's too. Some of their, and others', dialogue is too manufactured  at times, but that be just a minor complaint to be honest. The rest of those onscreen are satisfactory. I must say the director's father, Peter Gluck, gave me one of the film's stronger chuckles in his tiny role on the plane sat next to Sweeney - perfect line delivery!\r\n\r\nI had fun with this. As already noted, it isn't anything all that standout but it delivered what I evidently wanted. Solid. The William Shakespeare stuff was a bit forced, mind you.",

Everyone says how pretty and blessed she is, and this rather flies in the face of her natural humility. Imagine her shock, then, when she is summoned to the cardinal (Giorgio Colangeli) and made to undergo some rather personal medical tests that reveal.... Well that'd be telling, and for a while Michael Mohan manage to sustain a little interest in just what is going on amidst the peace and quiet of this ancient sanctuary. Sadly, though, the story swiftly goes way off the rails and leaves us exposed to Sweeney's limited talents and an excess of hysteria that involves a chicken, a dimly lit catacomb and a dastardly plan that puts enormous strain on our increasingly inventive and resilient novice. As \"Yoda\" might have profoundly said, \"loads of screaming and ketchup do not an horror film make\" and after about half an hour here the writing is on the wall (perhaps the best place for it?) and my interest wained. This is a tough genre to keep interesting - there are few ideas that have not been done to death before. This has the germ of originality, but sadly it's a very small germ.",

Second, the visuals are well made and often beautiful.\r\n\r\nBeing this unimaginative, the movie could have increased its entertainment value going the obvious route and show some nudity - Sydney Sweeney and the other nuns have lots to offer in this regard.

The Dark Knight Rises may very well have been the weakest of all 3 films but when you're talking about a scale of this magnitude, it still makes this one of the best movies I've seen in the past few years.\r\n\r\nI expected a little more _Batman_ than we got (especially with a runtime of 2:45) but while the story around the fall of Bruce Wayne and Gotham City was good I didn't find it amazing. This might be in fact, one of my only criticisms—it was a long movie but still, maybe too short for the story I felt was really being told. I feel confident in saying this big of a story could have been split into two movies.\r\n\r\nThe acting, editing, pacing, soundtrack and overall theme were the same 'as-close-to-perfect' as ever with any of Christopher Nolan's other films. Man does this guy know how to make a movie!\r\n\r\nYou don't have to be a Batman fan to enjoy these movies and I hope any of you who feel this way re-consider. These 3 movies are without a doubt in my mind, the finest display of comic mythology ever told on the big screen. They are damn near perfect.",

This is still a masterwork, and is an excellent coda to the finest filmic trilogy ever made.

              "content": "So here we have it. The end of a trilogy, the end of an era of the universe of Batman through the eyes of Christopher Nolan. And baby, it goes out with a bang...\r\n\r\nGoing into the theatre tonight I actually wasn't sure what I was up for. I loved Batman Begins, but I didn't actually care that much for The Dark Knight. So the big question was, will TDKR actually be more like the first or the second film? The answer is: neither.\r\n\r\nThis third instalment of the Nolan-franchise carries its weight all on its own merits. Despite the lack of any kind of intro or opening credits, there actually is plenty of build-up (partly thanks to the insane opening scene). The foundation for a proper, action-packed story is laid down perfectly, explaining things just enough whilst keeping the viewer intrigued to find out more. But if you thought that Nolan couldn't surpass his previous work, you will be pleasantly deceived.\r\n\r\nChristian Bale as Batman is terrific. Never before was a superhero so human, so vulnerable. As his mask of intangibility and anonymity slowly starts to crumble, this is a man who questions his reasons to keep being who he is, and he must figure it out before it is too late. Because somebody’s preparing to take him and Gotham down, and he might just be too strong for the Batman...\r\n\r\nThis somebody is a character called Bane. As a character, an actor and a performance it must be incredibly hard to follow Heath Ledger's The Joker, which was easily one of the greatest villains to ever appear on the silver screen. But tonight, Tom Hardy took a swing for the fence... and made it. His performance is thrilling and actually frightening, in the sense that you don't just *know* you're supposed to be afraid of this character, you actually FEEL it. He instils a feeling of horror and discomfort that is not rivalled by many other film villains. What I actually liked about his character the most is the fact that unlike Scarecrow, who grew into being a villain, and the Joker, who was just a raving maniac, Bane was actually (literally) born from evil. Born in hell, as it is said in the film. This is not a man, this is a creature. A living, breathing manifestation of evil that cannot be reasoned or negotiated with. Hardy's performance is masterful. Since his creepy mask is never removed, he, like only a few actors before him, must act without the use of any facial expressions, making his voice is main tool. His manner of speech (and the sound of it through his mask) is enough to send chills down your spine. This is more than just a another villain from a superhero flick, this is a character that just got torpedoed into the top 10 of the greatest antagonists in the history of film. Now I realise that's a bold statement to make, but you just go and watch TDKR and prove me wrong.\r\n\r\nI would say a slight downside to this film is the overflow of characters, both new and old. Aside from the already familiar characters, three new major ones are introduced. And there are also many characters running along in the margin which may seem not important enough to pay attention to, but actually they are so you need to stay focused.\r\n\r\nI understand the character of Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Blake, was written in specifically for him because Nolan wanted him in it. And although as a character he works just fine, it does feel like it was at the expense of Gary Oldman. As a cop, Levitt does everything that Oldman's character could've done, but he spends most of his screen time in the hospital, almost like they wanted to get him out of the way, and that's really too bad.\r\n\r\nNow, I was extremely excited to see what Nolan had done with Catwoman, because she is one of my favourite film characters. When I heard that she would be played by Anne Hathaway, I had my doubts. I thought she was just way too sweet to pull this off. But I must say, Ms Hathaway did a pretty good job. She is actually much more sly and devious than I thought she could be. The Nolan brothers, on the other hand, disappointed me here. Catwoman isn't really Catwoman, she's just a sexy girl in a spandex suit who can kick your ass. Her movements aren't even typically cat-like... So that was a bit of a letdown.\r\n\r\nI would also like to make a note on Michael Caine. I think his performance here was so much deeper and more character-driven than the other two films. In fact, there is one scene in particular, where he confesses something to Bruce, that almost moved me to tears. And this is actually TDKR’s greatest strength; unlike the other two films, this one deals much more with actual human emotions, it gives us an insight into what actually drives these characters, both heroes and villains alike. \r\n\r\nAs much as I would love to, the word-limit restricts me from elaborating more on the characters, so I'll just move on to the technical stuff. And in that department, actually pretty much everything was perfect. The pacing was very well balanced, and during those 2 ½ hours I didn't get bored once. Great action scenes alternate with more quiet moments, and the special effects are absolutely awesome. Hans Zimmer once again delivered a terrific score and there was some high quality dialogue. Also in store: a couple of great plot twists and two very cool cameos... There are a few plot holes, but everything else easily makes up for it. \r\n\r\nI highly recommend The Dark Knight Rises. It is a worthy conclusion to the trilogy, and it far exceeded my expectations.\r\n_(July 2012)_",

              "content": "Batman was one of my childhood heroes from the Comic magazines even though the Swedish plonkers, in their infinite stupidity, had renamed him to something as ridiculous “Läderlappen” which basically translates into “patch of leather”.\r\n\r\nThus, when Christopher Nolan brought us Batman Begins and steered away from the ridiculous comic shows that the previous batman movies (except the first one) had turned into I was thrilled. Unfortunately I was equally disappointed with this one.\r\n\r\nI think the title of the movie is quite misleading since Batman isn’t exactly rising at all but rather sinking. If this would have been a movie about some other “guy” it would probably have been excellent but it isn’t. It’s about Batman and as such I had expected him to be the hero going around beating up the bad guys.\r\n\r\nInstead the movie starts downright boring with Batman having dug himself down into a swamp of melancholy and closed himself off from the world. When he finally starts to appear again he gets pretty much beaten at every turn not to mention conned out of the Wayne fortune. What the f… is that? It isn’t until the end that he starts to be the real Batman and even then it’s not very exciting.\r\n\r\nActually Batman, as in Batman and not Wayne, is not really in the movie for a good chunk of the time and the real hero in this movie is really the young cop and he sure isn’t a particularly good substitute for the superhero Batman that I was expecting to watch.\r\n\r\nI was struggling with what to give this movie but in the end, since I probably would have thought it to be a good movie if it had not been labelled as a Batman movie, I gave it 5 out 10 stars. At least the special effects where quite okay.",

              "content": "Tom Hardy is superb in this denouement to Christopher Nolan's \"Batman\" trilogy. His depiction of the clever and malevolent \"Bane\" is intricate and terrifying in equal measure. Christian Bale also has the role very much under control now as he joins forces with his old pal \"Gordon\" (Gary Oldman) and jewel thief turned \"Catwoman\" (Anne Hathaway) to rise to his biggest challenge yet... What's great about this film is that is ties up all of the loose ends from the first two; it dots some i's and crosses the t's as the story neatly, and frequently quite subtly, introduces new threads to an old suit of clothes. This is an hugely characterful outing for all concerned - especially Sir Michael Caine as the wonderfully underplayed \"Alfred\" and Morgan Freeman as the arch-inventor \"Fox\". The plot takes it's time to develop, there is plenty of to-ing and fro-ing as they battle for the upper hand; new allies must learn to trust and to rely on each other. I found myself drawn to the \"Bane\" cause more than I ought to admit - a sign of a great baddie; you empathise with the evil (I think of \"Darth Vader\") especially once the story unveils traits in his character and elements of his history that, to a certain extent, justify his behaviour. The dialogue is sparing and potent and photography is really effective: the light and shade are used creatively with the Hans Zimmer score an huge improvement on his last outing. This is certainly one for a big screen - there is loads to see each time you watch, and though \"Batman\" was never my favourite super-hero, this has to be up there as one of the darkest and best super-hero films.",

Knowing the Burton, Donner and Nolan filmic adaptations of Batman and Superman exist helps me to sleep at night. They are Exhibit A of 'How to Make a Comic-Book Movie'. Nothing else has ever come even remotely close. These seven films (I include 'Superman II' because it was mostly Donner's work)--and Nolan's trilogy especially--are what I imagine a great director like Kubrick, Hitchcock or Kurosawa would have come up with, if they had ever been asked to make a Superman or Batman movie. They are the easiest for an audience to identify with because in these the scripts most approximate human emotions and the typical conundrums of the human experience--in short, are the closest, in a good way, they come to the complexities of the human condition.

Christian Bale returns as Batman, was able to perform as wonderfully as he did in Batman Begins. The one person that ultimately stole the show had to be the late Heath Ledger who played as the Joker. His performance as a psychotic clown terrorizing Gotham City was one of the best performance as a superhero villain. One of the best parts of the Joker was when he was telling his victims on how “he got his scars?”. Another great part was when he kidnapped a police officer and he was recording it while scaring the man and also giving a warning to Batman. The supporting actor and actresses did a good job of delivering the story. I was disappointed that Katie Holmes did not return as Rachael Dawes but the actress how played as her Maggie Gyllenhaal did a really good job. One of the best parts of Christopher Nolan is that in every movie of his, the cinematography would look amazing and this movie is no exception.",

The editing represents that of an anti-pirate commercial and the politics are beyond reprehensible. The film ends with a monologue about how violent law-enforcement and brutality is what the country needs, but does not deserve. Nolan clearly did not intend for any subtext, yet that is not an excuse, if anything, that makes it worse. He includes these scenes to make the film more dark and edgy, yet there are people, from suppressed countries, who have to live through the hardships of violence from law-enforcers and dictatorship every day, and in his obliviousness, Nolan thinks that using this in a superhero film is a good excuse for self-importance. He is a war profiteer, and exploiter, and this is nothing short of disgusting.",

              "content": "Heath Ledger is outstanding in this follow up to the 2006 \"Batman Begins\" outing for the caped crusader. His portrayal of the malevolent \"Joker' is confident and highly entertaining, treading a fine line between supreme intellect and total insanity with considerable aplomb. He comes back to terrorise \"Gotham\" after \"Batman\" (Christian Bale), \"Gordon\" (Gary Oldman) - now Commissioner in charge of the police force, and newly installed District Attorney \"Dent\" (Aaron Eckhart) had made progress getting the criminals off the street. The \"Joker\", meantime, decides that the best strategy is to rob the mob - and pitching them all against each other, and with the help of the duplicitous \"Lau\" (Chin Han) manages to secure enough of their funds to initiate a campaign of lawlessness that is ruthless, manipulative and good fun to watch. Not only has the man in black his new, potent, nemesis to deal with - but he also begins to realise that his childhood sweetheart \"Rachel\" (this time Maggie Gyllenhaal) is drifting into the arms of the new DA. it is also pretty clear that they are both now proving to be an useful additional weapon in the armoury of his enemy who knows, increasingly, which buttons to press to cause maximum anxiety among those who would bring him down. It's over 2½ hours long, but really does fly by as the quickly paced action really does kick in right from the start. The story is dark and gritty but the pace isn't ponderous and moody - Ledger exudes a sense of peril throughout the whole thing, but that has an edge to it - a sophistication that plays well against the flawed superhero who is increasingly having to identify and cope with his own demons. Sir Michael Caine pops up now and again as his shrewd butler \"Alfred\", always striving to keep his boss on the right side of sanity, and Morgan Freeman continues to feature (sparingly) and his quartermaster. On that latter front, there are loads of new gadgets that still have that element of plausibility to them (no super-powers!). On balance I think I still preferred the first film, but as sequels go - this takes, and will take, some beating. On a big screen in a packed cinema, it's just a great experience.",

              "content": "Even worse than Tim Burton's Batman, although obviously copying the neo Nazi ideology of \"kill all the brunettes you can in a movie\".\r\nThis is so predictable and so poorly written that it boggles the mind. Yet there is a fan base of what can only be described as neo Nazis. I guess those fans were poor cuckolds who got jilted by too many brunettes at a young age, and they couldn't get over it.\r\nThat's about the entire story here. Oh, the Joker kills anything he sees. Whoopee. And he's invulnerable. And he's a demigod who can only be beaten by another demigod.\r\nSo, we've got traditional mundane Greek heroes and villains here, just like most Hollywood movies.\r\nUnfortunately, the fans of these traditional Hollywood movies are the loudest people on Earth, and the biggest control freaks. It's ridiculous to believe there are actually this big a percentage of fans for this kind of depressing Hollywood formula movie making, but if you look at Imdb's top 250, you see such movies make up over half of the top 250. Are they voted up because control freaks vote more than non control freaks? Or are they voted up because control freaks use many fake user names? Probably both, which explains why over half of the top 250 are nothing more than Greek traditional idolizations of control freaks.\r\nOh, and Batman turns totally gay, which would be okay if he'd admit it, but he's given the choice of saving a man from death or a hot woman from death, and he chooses to save the man. This isn't any real Batman. It's just another contrived story line for the Nolan Nazi merit badge. They are not even subtle. They bang you over the head with their worship of Adolf and Eva. \r\nGod help the world if this garbage still has a fan base fifty years from now. But it could happen. We may have drug addicts and meth heads around for even longer than that, praising the hate and feeding the hate. It would be nice if someone made a real Batman movie with a real story line involving some degree of motivation.",

              "content": "The Dark Knight (2008), directed by Christopher Nolan, isn’t just another superhero film—it’s a gripping piece of cinema that balances action, emotion, and a deep exploration of morality and chaos. It’s the kind of movie that lingers with you, not because of its spectacle, but because of the questions it asks and the unforgettable performances it delivers. Chief among those is Heath Ledger’s Joker, a portrayal that reshaped how we see villains.\r\n\r\nLedger’s performance as the Joker is nothing short of extraordinary. He’s chaotic and unpredictable, yet his presence is magnetic—every moment he’s on screen feels alive with tension. From his unsettling voice to his haunting laugh, he created a character that’s terrifyingly human yet larger than life. Ledger didn’t just act the part; he became the Joker, and it’s a performance that still sends chills down your spine. It’s no wonder he was awarded a posthumous Oscar—this wasn’t just a role; it was a transformation.\r\n\r\nChristian Bale continues to bring depth to Bruce Wayne, exploring his inner conflict and the weight of his decisions as Gotham’s protector. Aaron Eckhart as Harvey Dent adds a tragic layer to the story, showing how even the noblest intentions can be corrupted. Gary Oldman, Michael Caine, and Morgan Freeman bring warmth and stability to a world teetering on the edge of chaos.\r\n\r\nWhat really sets The Dark Knight apart, though, is Nolan’s storytelling. He doesn’t just focus on action—though the film has some of the most intense sequences you’ll see—but on creating a story that makes you think. The way it explores the fragile balance between order and chaos, the cost of heroism, and the power of fear, makes it a deeply compelling watch. Add to that the breathtaking visuals and Hans Zimmer’s score, which pulses with urgency, and you’ve got a film that’s as thrilling as it is thought-provoking.\r\n\r\nHere’s a fun tidbit: Ledger’s iconic scene where he claps in the jail cell was entirely unscripted. It’s one of those moments that perfectly captures the Joker’s unsettling genius, and it’s all thanks to Ledger’s improvisation.\r\n\r\nThe Dark Knight is a film that deserves all the praise it gets. It’s intense, thoughtful, and unforgettable, with Heath Ledger delivering one of the most iconic performances of all time. If you haven’t seen it yet—or even if you have—it’s a movie that’s always worth revisiting.",

Renouncing his Christianity he pledges to return from the death to enact revenge on humanity. Century's later he is back to keep his word but becomes infatuated with Mina (Winona Ryder) who bears a resemblance to his long dead true love.\r\n\r\nForget the Bram Stoker bit, this is liberty taken wholesale, and forget any notion of this being a scary Dracula movie, for this is Gothic romance opulence. There is no doubting that as a production design goes, it's top dollar, costumes, photography, score, sets and puppetry etc, all the money is up there on the screen to please the eyes and the ears. But the narrative shift to make Dracula a tragic longing figure is a mistake, as is several casting decisions and performances. It's actually easier to say who comes out of it with credit, so step up Tom Waits as Renfield and Richard E. Grant as Dr. John Seward. Oldman is committed to the lead role, and has tortured soul down pat, but someone thought it was a good idea to make him an old ponce and stick a set of buttocks on his head! You just can't take the character seriously from the moment he appears on screen.\r\n\r\nThere's some vampire erotica as Coppola caters for the horny horror faithful, though these scenes play out like an after midnight MTV video, so not really very sexy at all. While there's a lot of fun to be had, yes you read right, with a number of scenes inserted within the dull narrative: did the great Anthony Hopkins just sniff the cheese and Keanu Reeves attempt a posh British accent? Aaargh! It should have been a Gothic classic, but clearly Coppola was out of his depth tackling such a genre. After giving myself over ten years between returning to watch the film again, I can say with confidence that it's a film that gets worse on repeat viewings. That is unless you like unintentional comedy pictures? 3/10",

              "content": "Gary Oldman is super in this hammy reimagining of the tale of the legendary Count Dracula. Having lured his lawyer - the unsuspecting, and frankly rather insipid, \"Harker\" (Keanu Reeves) to his Transylvanian Castle he employs cunning and guile to use him to acquire \"Carfax Abbey\" in England. He also has designs on the young man's glamorous fiancée \"Mina\" (Winona Ryder) and is soon set to acquire much more than just the eerie stately pile. Luckily, \"Prof. Van Helsing\" (Anthony Hopkins) is on hand to help our rather hapless hero and perhaps they can thwart the evil intentions of their vampiric visitor? Francis Ford Coppola presents us here with a highly stylised interpretation of the legend. At times it does border on the Hammer style of production with the gore and peril really unconvincing for most of the film. The heavily made up Reeves is easy enough on the eye, but his accent is tougher on the ears and his performance is more about box office than generating any sense of menace as his red-clothed nemesis marauds around in a wig Marie Antoinette would have found fitting. It does send itself up, and that works - there is plenty that is theatrical about it, and that is what helps make this iteration distinctive. Oldman looks even inch the megalomaniac as he effortlessly glides, purrs and munches his way from Romania to Victorian England. Ryder delivers well - her part has very little substance to it, yet she does rise above the all too obvious damsel in distress persona. There are also valuable supporting efforts from Richard E. Grant and the eagle eyed might spot sword and sandals veteran Jay Robinson as \"Hawkins\". Wojciech Kilar's score helps create quite an atmosphere too, especially as we enter the last half hour of against the clock drama. I didn't much care for the way the ending is portrayed but after two hours of quickly paced and colourful entertainment, that maybe didn't matter so much. This really does need big screen visuals to have any real impact, and if you can find a cinema screening then this is very much at the better end of the Dracula genre of output - even if it does play rather fast and loose with the book!",

              "content": "Lots of rocks everywhere...\r\n\r\nIt's CGI destruction time as Dwayne Johnson battles earthquakes and a tsunami to go rescue his daughter - with estranged wife in tow of course.\r\n\r\nDisaster films are easy to kick because very rarely they are nothing more than candy carnage with a trite screenplay and cheese laden dialogue. Such is the case with San Andreas. In essence this is a remake of Roland Emmerich's 2012, only this is the shorter version with the time span that 2012 should have had. This does exactly what the marketing department promised it would, namely lots of crash bang and wallop, but just like Emmerich's behemoth it gets boring entering the final third, the writing just not good enough to hold interest once the noise and destruction dies down before the big finale arrives. Suspense is absent, emotional investment in characters is null and void, while there are no worthwhile surprises in store. But on the plus side Johnson is a likable guy and he carries us through till the end of what is a fun movie if expectation levels are appropriately set at dumb popcorn fodder. 6/10",

              "content": "This is a classical Hollywood movie, thin plot and a lot of effects. However, this time, I quite liked it. Actually I liked it a lot. The plot, although thin, is not altogether bad, it holds together even though are quite a few unbelievable moments. However, put in the context of a traditional disaster movie, it is not bad.. Maybe this is what I like about the movie. It is really a good old fashioned disaster movie.\r\n\r\nWhen I first read the blurb about this movie I was afraid that it was going to be a big apocalypse at the beginning and then it was going to be a “slow” search for Ray’s daughter. It is nothing of the kind. It has a decent build up of suspense up to quite a few more or less spectacular earth quake scenes … and then it continues. I was pretty happy that there was a decent build up from the start but I was even more happy that the initial earth wrecking event was actually not the big event.\r\n\r\nAs I wrote at the beginning, the plot is pretty thin. The special effects are not however. At least, I liked them. Not surprisingly houses a are falling over like there was no tomorrow (which for a lot of people there are not) but it is done quite well. I also liked the scenes where the earth wobbles when Ray and his wife flies over it in his chopper. I found that quite cool. There are a few moments that are, well let us say not too well thought through. For instance the classical collapsing building that collapses in the just the right pace for the heroes to do there job. The we have when Ray and his wife speeds through the waters of Los Angeles after the quake, which are riddled with trash. The amount of trash in the water would have rendered their propeller useless after a few hundred meters. But then, I think I am too much of an engineer now.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of Ray’s wife. That was one of the things I really did not like with the movie. Maybe the movie directors and actors in Hollywood are so used to divorcing all the time that they think it is a “standard” plot element and do not think twice about it but for us other “ordinary” people it is a tragedy (especially people outside of the US apparently if one should go by the trash that is spewed out from Hollywood all the time) and I really do not want to watch that crap all the time in movies and TV-shows! I was actually tempted to downgrade the movie at last a star, even two, for that crap but what the heck, it is a good movie and I do like “The Rock”.\r\n\r\nSo after, after that little outburst, I have to say that I this one was a really enjoyable movie. One of the few lately that I have watched. It is a quite good, classical, disaster movie with a good build up, really good effects and a good and happy ending (for the main characters at last) and I am a sucker for happy endings.",

              "content": "Baywatch is a movie based off the popular TV show of the same name which launched the careers of such acting talents as Yasmine Bleeth and Pam Anderson. And then those quickly died right afterwards but hey, the show ran like 11 years andlittle known fact, Jason Mamoa was on spin-off show Baywatch: Hawaii.\r\n\r\nThe movie is very much like the show; as in if you walk in expecting to take it seriously you're already watching it wrong. The situations people need to be rescued from are just as ridiculous and far-fetched and the main plot here gets far more convoluted and hackneyed than the average day of any real lifeguard.\r\n\r\nAnd like 21 Jump Street and a bunch of lesser TV to movie adaptations, this seeks to make fun of all of it, plus all the slo-mo beach running. Does it come off as good as Jump Street? No. Do we need this? God no. I mean didn't the show basically already make fun of itself enough as it is?\r\n\r\nBut all I can say here, and I guess the only thing anyone interested in this might want to know is, it could have been so much worse. I'm not saying this is the best movie of the summer so far. I don't really even know if i'm saying this is a good movie. But it's easy enough to sit through and the laughs, while not great, are consistent.\r\n\r\nWhere the script sucks, the cast knows how to make fun of itself. The Rock is the head honcho who takes the job very seriously. Zac Efron is the selfish, cool pretty boy new trainee who clashes with him. Both have a plethora of jokes for one another that work with varying degrees of success.\r\n\r\nThere's a fat lifeguard and the movie takes the shots you would expect it to take but actor Jon Bass also does have some comedic talent here in the Josh Gadd sense of the word. Actually he may even be funnier than Josh Gadd. Point is he works the best here from a comedic perspective.\r\n\r\nThe movie gives us quite a few dick jokes but this dude actually has one embarrassing moment that may rank up there with \"There's Something About Mary\", just with not as good a payoff.\r\n\r\nHannibal Burress also gets a couple scenes for a cameo and I love when he gets those. It's time for Burress to headline a movie though.\r\n\r\nThe women aren't as funny but I guess you can say they add some nice support to that and the action. Alexandra Daddario has shown a few times she's a pretty decent actress, and the others don't just seem like stiffs there to just show off a hot body. Priyanka Chopra is also here as the villain, and she's fine.\r\n\r\nThe whole movie can really be described as fine. It's funny and doesn't take itself too seriously and the cast all seems game for it. You don't have to see, but if you do, know it's already planning on sequels.\r\n\r\nSo I go 6 out of 10 on this one.

Then it was too sexy, that I was not allowed to watch. The world has changed so much all these years. I always wanted to see that, but never had a chance. Now a film, possibly a new franchise if it all goes well. There were lots of expectations on it, but the film did not deliver that. Yet they have already announced a sequel.\r\n\r\nThe bay security team is now recruiting new members. Three joins as the trainee after the tryout. Within a few days, a couple of suspicious deaths happen in the bay. The cops are not worried to solve it, but the Baywatch team jumps in and starts their own investigation. That leads them to a dangerous territory. From there, how they deal with it was revealed with some action-thriller.\r\n\r\nPumped up body, starring alongside a current top star, nothing is working for Zac Efron. He's just an accidental actor, won't survive long, unless he turns it all his way like Ben Afflect did. On the other hand, Dwayne was awesome. All the other actors too. Priyanka was not ideal for such role. Because an Indian in a negative role for an American film, nah, it does not work. India keeps all the thugs and sends only engineers, doctors, scientist et cetera to the foreign lands. A Chinese or a Russian villain works better.\r\n\r\nNo suspense. Everything was open from the beginning itself. Some of the comedies were good, but some were most absurd. Especially, I did not like the storyline. The Bay security force not doing their job, but police work. It goes completely out of the frame. It's okay doing same within their enclosure, but the film entered beyond that. Thus, the film missed to cover the beach events as what the title had promised. I hope the sequel would fall in line.\r\n\r\n_3/10_",

The cast is oversized, way too many characters.

C. J. (Kelly Rohrbach) and Ronnie (Jon Bass), meanwhile, are annoying and extremely pointless. Yahya Abdul-Mateen II (Ellerbee) is solid in a small role.\r\n\r\nI've never watched the original television series so maybe I missed a few callbacks etc., while there are two (incredibly forced) cameos from it.

              "content": "If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog @ https://www.msbreviews.com\r\n\r\nStar Wars is a very special franchise to millions of people around the world, myself included. I remember when The Force Awakens was announced, and everyone got excited and pumped to experience this beautiful universe once again. However, with social media having a massive impact, the huge fanbase transformed into something so disrespectful and hateful that I find no longer fun discussing the saga with other aficionados... except for The Mandalorian.\r\n\r\nIf I had to bet that Jon Favreau was going to create such an astonishing Star Wars series that the whole fanbase would unanimously love, I would have lost so much money because I would have bet against this. There's no denying that the newest cinematic trilogy is one of the most divisive in the history of cinema. But there's also no denying that The Mandalorian belongs to the saga's universally beloved pieces of cinema/television.\r\n\r\nThis show is a near-perfect depiction of what the universe looks like post-Empire. Some are looking for scraps of the war to make themselves some money, others are trying to hunt criminals to collect bounties, like The Mandalorian or Mando for short (I will use the latter to refer to the character). Following Pedro Pascal's lead character, one that has no name or face throughout the season can be a challenging task in the sense that it's hard to emotionally connect with someone who we wouldn't recognize in the streets. Except we do.\r\n\r\nPascal's facial performance might be impossible to evaluate, but his body movements and attitude are so unique that Mando can be easily distinguished from the remaining members of his Guild. Obviously, his costume also helps to tell him apart from other Mandalorians. However, it's the rich, intelligent writing that surprises me. After a few episodes, I feel like I know Mando, even if he doesn't say much. I understand his life principles, who he trusts, who he doesn't... Yes, there are a bunch of secret past adventures that molded him into being what he is (I'll get there). Still, a simple action like not selling something, not killing someone, or simply a helmet turn a bit faster/slower goes a long way to show the audience who's the character we are supposed to support.\r\n\r\nEvery single episode is packed with entertainment. There's always some action, and it always brings something new. It can be an innovative trick, a different location, or new characters like Baby Yoda, who undoubtedly becomes the star of the show, and I'll leave it at that. I won't develop or spoil what everyone is or does, but I do have to mention Gina Carano (Cara) and Carl Weathers (Greef Karga). Both are important to the storyline, and both actors deliver great performances. If Gina gives her all during the action sequences, Carl uses his eloquent speech to provide the necessary exposition.\r\n\r\nIf there was a slight doubt regarding Disney's commitment to this show, the mind-blowing production level shuts down any question about that subject. This series doesn't merely resemble Star Wars, it *feels* like Star Wars. The whole season looks absolutely stunning! Gorgeous cinematography, fantastic set designs, and even the costumes of each species look amazing. Technically, it's one of the best TV shows of the decade, and every director does a tremendous job.\r\n\r\nOne other aspect I love is how each episode feels different. Each director brings his/her personal filmmaking flair, making every chapter feel new every time. Dave Filoni, who fans will know from the animated Star Wars series, does a good job with the pilot. Deborah Chow, who's the sole director of the Obi-Wan series, delivers brilliant action and a fast pace. Rick Famuyiwa puts a horror vibe into his sequences. And Taika Waititi (who also performs the voice of a droid named IG-11) ends the season with a thunderous finale. However, it's due to Jon Favreau's screenplay that everything works together so seamlessly. Impeccable writing, especially concerning the protagonist.\r\n\r\nI have just one issue with the debut season, which is the overall plot. For a long time, it doesn't feel like it has one. It feels like entertainment for the sake of entertainment, just with compelling characters. Following Mando from planet to planet, from mission to mission, can be tons of fun, but if that's all the season has to give, then that fun can quickly turn into monotony (chapter five is definitely the favorite for the worst episode of the season). A lot of questions concerning Mando's past keep coming up, and while I understand that the series needs to have something for a second season, I also feel that a few answers here and there could have helped the story.\r\n\r\nIf there's one thing that The Mandalorian proves is that Disney has more than enough capabilities to produce a great Star Wars piece... as long as it has someone supervising it with a clear plan and structure, which didn't happen with the sequel trilogy. It isn't a coincidence that the two episodes with no involvement of Favreau on the writing are the season's worst. The apparent lack of a central plot can be damaging, but not enough to steal the \"best Star Wars TV series\" crown.\r\n\r\nWith an outstanding cast and talented directors, Jon Favreau offers the world the opportunity to live in the Star Wars universe, following Pedro Pascal's character in some of the most entertaining adventures the saga has ever witnessed. Technically superb, with stunning cinematography, excellent editing, an addictive score (it can feel weird in the beginning, but it grew on me), and amazing directing from everyone involved. Nevertheless, it's Favreau's writing and well-planned season's structure that make this debut a gigantic success. Undoubtedly, one of the best shows of the year.\r\n\r\nRating: A",

While yes, the pacing was a bit slower than the game's first few moments, I felt like it was appropriate to set the stage for everything to come later. TLOU is one of my favorite games on the planet, and I am really hard to please when it comes to media. I am the definition of nit-picky when it comes to writing, production, and character development, especially with pre-existing and beloved material. I can say honestly, and without reservation that if the creators put as much attention to detail and fan-oriented storytelling into the later episodes of this season, this could easily be one of the best adaptations of a game, out there. I really can't wait to see what they do with it.",

But it is far from living up to its potential. And episode 3 has show us that it can really suck (no pun intended) at times.\r\n\r\nI am going to loosely address some reasons for why I think this show is disappointing and not as good as it could be:\r\n\r\n- Bad casting of main characters, unnecessary type-switching.\r\n\r\nThough I think that most of the actors are good, a lot of them and especially the main characters are not matching their counterparts from the game and the game (at least TLOU, Part I) just nailed it. The actors are good, but the casting choices still are just bad. Especially Ellie is just miscast all the way.\r\n\r\n- Bad chemistry between the characters.\r\n\r\nThere is no matching chemistry between the actors of Joel & Tess or Joel & Ellie.\r\n\r\n- Pointless deviations from the original story (see episode 3).\r\n\r\nThose deviations don't add anything good to the story, they are just annoying distraction at best and derailment at worst.\r\n\r\n- Sometimes just stupid, boring or pointless.\r\n\r\nThere is more examples than just the bigger part of episode 3 for that.\r\n\r\n- Mediocre storytelling.\r\n\r\nWhen it sticks to the main plot, it's not bad. But it's not really good either.\r\n\r\nAfter episode 3 I decided to take a break from watching the show and before I would continue to watch, I will wait till the whole season has aired and the reviews came in. If according to the non-shill and non-cheerleader reviews the show will give us more crap in the direction of episode 3, I'm out for good.",

Pedro Pascal and Bella Ramsey are perfect as Joel and Ellie. Their chemistry and emotional death are truly a outstanding. The guest staring roles are absolutely fantastic. Anna Torv, Gabriel Luna, Nick Offerman, Murray Bartlett, Lamar Johnson, Keivonn Montreal Woodard and Melanie Lynskey. Also having some of the original actors from the game in the series is also great. I can’t say enough about how the production design team transform Canada into a post apocalyptic hell hole. They should get all of the awards just for that. And I almost forgot the clickers their design is absolutely just on point. I could go on and on about this show. However I’m just going to that any new series that comes out after this is going to have a tough time. Because The Last of Us is by far the best series of 2023.",

Joel (Pascal) and Ellie (Ramsey) need to travel across an America devastated by a fungus which turns people into infectious 'zombies' or rogue raiders. The two main characters are brilliantly played and I think this probably secures Bella Ramsey's career. The rendering of the devastated landscapes and cities was amazing and very plausible. The plot was thin but enough to keep one's interest and, I'd guess, thicker than the computer game and most other zombie apocolypse films. I think it is probably an advantage to not know the video game and a disadvantage to having watched 'The Worst Witch' which took me a couple of episodes to shake off.",

Cast is also good and bad at the same time. For example Pedro Pascal is doing amazing job playing Joel and is actually very similar to game character. I think they did good job matching this actor to the character. Gerrard Buttler would be another great choice as well. Actress who's playing Ellie's character is nailing it as well, although in game she has blue eyes and actress has brown eyes. But I think it's not that bad. But like I said, there are bad matches too because of propaganda put in this show as well sadly. For example, Joe's daughter in original source (game) is white, however geniuses in show decided that black daughter should be better for him. Also, Tommy's new wife is white in game, but in show they made her black on purpose which is very obvious. Also there's whole episode dedicated to LGBT propaganda (episode 3). Sady this crap is ruining amazing show, but it is what it is... That's why I'm  giving this show 7/10. If not the cancer woke agenda, I would give it 10/10. I mean, if we close an eye on propaganda, show itself is very good and interesting and very close to original game. It's hundred times better that Witcher adapatation of game which is horribly ruined completely by the propaganda. In short, this show isn't perfect, but it's still good and there are far worse propaganda plagued shows nowadays.",

But on a seemingly routine spacewalk, disaster strikes. The Shuttle is destroyed, leaving Stone and Kowalsky completely alone-tethered to nothing but each other and spiraling out into the blackness of space. The deafening silence tells them they have lost any link to Earth and any chance for rescue. As fear turns to panic, every gulp of air eats away at what little oxygen is left. But the only way home may be to go further out into the terrifying expanse of space.",

This is probably a movie that would benefit from being watched in a good theater with its grandiose scenery.\n\nHowever, I have to say that I found the rest of the movie somewhat mediocre. The part that I felt dragged down the movie the most is that Dr. Ryan is behaving rather clumsily and amateurish first being real slow in obeying the order to evacuate and then floating around huffing and puffing, talking a lot when she should really conserve oxygen. Did they not give her the basic course before letting her up in space? I also found it soooo Hollywood that she was able to get onto the Chinese space station and seconds later it starts to descend into the atmosphere. In general I felt that the script writer was not really very technically knowledgeable.\n\nOverlooking these, unfortunately all too often occurring issues, the movie is fairly okay as a whole. Obviously I cannot agree with the glowing all-star ratings that some people have been giving it but it is far from the single star trashing that other people have been giving it. Technically it was very good with nice special effects. Bullock performed as well as can be expected with the script she was given. Clooney felt a bit out-of-place as a skilled astronaut to me but then he was not really in the movie that much.\n\nTo me it was a fairly enjoyable popcorn movie.",

I'm not a fan of the whole tens of improbable bad events happening in sequence genre, but this is just taking it to a whole other level.\r\n\r\nThe protagonist just presses random buttons and is so incompetent you wonder how she even became an astronaut. The physics and orbital mechanics in this movie make absolutely zero sense. One example out of the hundreds: it's highly improbable that the ISS and Tiangong would be within viewing distance of one another. And if they were they wouldn't stay that way for the roughly 2 hours the movie lasts, since they had very different inclinations. It would be impossible to reach one from the other with a single thrust designed for landing, even more impossible with manual controls. The first couple attempted rendezvous in history were from distances of 5 km (not the 100 in the movie) and failed, even though the pilots were clearly more competent than the protagonist here. There are so many errors here, I wouldn't be surprised if the Earth was flat (at least it would make the movie funny). This isn't just nitpicking since the movie tries to be realistic, but fails miserably.\r\n\r\nSure, the CGI is nice, but that's hardly a selling point in this day and age (or when the movie launched)",

Well, \"Kevin\", \"Stuart\" and baby \"Bob\" find are determined to settle this, and so are easy prey for the scheming \"Scarlet Overkill\" who has plans to commit the mother of all crimes. Not since George Zucco tried it in 1939 has anyone ever tried to steal the Crown Jewels from the Tower of London. She's tired of playing second fiddle to the men in the criminal fraternity but can her diminutive yellow henchmen facilitate her way to the Queen's throne itself. Loads of daft escapades and some duplicity later things come to an head with Beefeaters, a dungeon, dinky police cars and a good soundtrack to accompany their adventures. It's quite good fun, this, with loads of quickly paced action and some quite wittily scripted scenarios keeping ninety minutes of goggle-eyed action worth watching. The garbled baby-squeak does grate after a while but this is clearly just an introductory means to an end, this film, as the denouement shouts sequel at us and we meet a true nemesis of the law-abiding world.",

A group of Californians find succor in an abode with covered windows. One woman (Sandra Bullock) and two children try to make it down a remote river to find sanctuary, blindfolded. Trevante Rhodes and John Malkovich costar. \r\n\r\n“Bird Box” (2018) is a post-apocalyptic survival adventure/horror with an original concept and elements of flicks like “The Book of Eli” (2010), “The Mist” (2007), “Carriers” (2009) and “Stake Land” (2010). The reason for the apocalypse is what makes “Bird Box” standout and, thankfully, there are no zombies, yet it’s the least of these for a couple of reasons.\r\n\r\nFor one, I didn’t find the dramatic dynamics of the group all that captivating, but it was okay. If you’re a fan of Bullock you’ll probably like this movie more than me. I appreciated Rosa Salazar as Lucy, but her role isn’t that significant. Meanwhile Rhodes and Malkovich are effective.\r\n\r\nThe concept behind the mass crisis is where the movie fails. It’s sort of explained and yet it isn’t. There are too many inconsistencies and what appears to be plot holes. It’s basically a bunch of malarkey and reflects lazy writing. People on message boards debate back-and-forth ad nauseam, but the movie’s too nonsensical and meh to make it worth the effort.\r\n\r\nThe film runs 2 hours and 4 minutes and was shot in Southern Cal (Monrovia, La Puente, Santa Clarita, Smith River, Scripps College and Los Angeles).\r\n\r\nGRACE: C",

All the dialogue and story arcs are great, but the RIDICULOUS insistence on re-ordering a story and not benefiting from it is just annoying.\r\n\r\nThe second half of the story is interspersed with the first half of the story so you alternate back and forth.

The whole movie is slowly building up the dread of the pagan cult, but fails to deliver when it comes to showcasing the brutality toward the end, and after two hours of  build up it's baffling how minute the payoff is. The performances are fantastic, though! And I love watching Swedish people scream.",

Whereas _Hereditary_ had an 89% critical approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes, with an average score of 8.26/10, it managed only a 65% audience approval rating, with an average score of 3.43/5, whilst also famously garnering a pitiful D+ CinemaScore. _Midsommar_ currently has an 82% critical approval with a 7.51/10 average, against a 61% audience approval, with a 3.36/5 average and a C+ CinemaScore. This recalls recent films such as Robert Eggers's _The VVitch: A New England Folktale_ (90% with a 7.77/10 average vs 58% with a 3.22/5 average and a C- CinemaScore) and Trey Edward Shults's superb _It Comes At Night_ (87% with a 7.36/10 average vs 44% with a 2.75/5 average and a D CinemaScore). The reason for the discrepancies? In large part it's because all four films were promoted as something they weren't, drawing in audiences who were disappointed that they didn't get what they were expecting; all four were heavily promoted as horrors, when none in fact are (and in the case of _It Comes At Night_, not even remotely close). As for _Midsommar_, it is, at best, a thriller, and I would argue that even that's pushing it. Whereas _Hereditary_ was a study of grief and familial breakdown, it undeniably had horror elements (the floating self-decapitation scene is one of the most haunting images put on screen in decades). In the case of _Midsommar_, however, apart from one very brief moment involving somebody wearing somebody else's skin (don't ask), there's nothing remotely resembling a horror trope, and very little that's thrilling. Which is not necessarily a criticism; I enjoyed the film very much, I simply think the marketing people have once again set the movie up to fail with a lot of the people who will see it.\r\n\r\nWhat _Midsommar_ does have in abundance, however, is dread, which is, of course, very different to horror. More unsettling than frightening, as with _Hereditary_, _Midsommar_ is primarily an allegory built on a foundation of generic tropes – both films begin with paralysing tragedies that almost cripple the protagonist, with the subsequent narrative analysing the psychological reaction to such tragedies by way of various spooky goings-on. And whereas _Hereditary_ dealt with the lengths one may go to shut off deep emotional pain, _Midsommar_ is more interested in what happens when the initial pain of bereavement starts to wear off, especially when the only person one feels one can turn to isn't exactly sympathetic to one's situation. Aster himself has called it a \"_breakup movie_\", and it's hard to argue against this categorisation, as the story begins and ends with very specific relationship drama. And whilst the characters are grossly underwritten, and the film is painfully predictable (if you're familiar with Robin Hardy's _The Wicker Man_ (1973), chances are that everything you think is going to happen in _Midsommar_ does happen), it's beautifully crafted, brilliantly shot almost entirely in glaring sunlight, and vastly ambitious in scope (it runs 147 minutes). Indeed, it's the type of film where you can tell the director was given an unusual amount of freedom to fulfil their vision. And whilst that can often result in unmitigated disaster (think filmmakers such as Michael Cimino, Richard Kelly, and David Robert Mitchell), much like Jordan Peele's _Us_ (2019), _Midsommar_ avoids the dreaded sophomore slump without necessarily knocking it out of the park.\r\n\r\nThe film begins as Dani Ardor (a superb Florence Pugh) is hit with the kind of tragedy from which many would find it impossible to recover - her bipolar sister has killed their parents and subsequently committed suicide. Already emotionally fragile and prone to anxiety attacks even before their deaths, the incident sends Dani spiralling into despair, turning for support to her boyfriend Christian (Jack Reynor), an anthropology student struggling to find a topic for his PhD thesis. Unfortunately, for some time, Christian has wanted to break things off with Dani, as he finds her overly needy, and he had been trying to work up to ending the relationship when her family died. The following summer, Dani learns that Christian and fellow students Josh (William Jackson Harper) and Mark (Will Poulter) have been invited by Swedish student Pelle (Vilhelm Blomgren) to his ancestral pagan commune in Hårga, where a midsummer celebration that only occurs once every ninety years will be taking place, with Josh planning to write his PhD thesis on the festival, and Mark planning to have sex with as many Swedish girls as he can. Dani is upset that Christian didn't tell her about the trip, and to placate her, he invites her to come, never imagining she will say yes. But she does, much to Mark's disgust, and so the foursome accompany Pelle to Sweden, meeting the disturbingly polite and welcoming members of the commune, as well as English students Connie (Ellora Torchia) and Simon (Archie Madekwe), who were invited by Pelle's brother Ingemar (Hampus Hallberg). It doesn't take long, however, for the visitors to learn that things aren't exactly kosher in the commune - whether it's the elderly couple who fling themselves from the top of a cliff, the pies with pubic hair in them, the \"oracle\" child specifically bred through incest, the caged bear who seems to have no function in the festival, the strange yellow pyramid building which they are forbidden from entering, the elaborate murals depicting violence and torture, or the communal wailing.\r\n\r\n_Midsommar_ originally began life as a slasher movie set in a Swedish commune, until Aster revised the script to focus on a toxic relationship after going through a particularly bad breakup himself. Christian is your garden variety manipulator, who uses Dani's emotional vulnerability against her. For example, in a brilliantly written early scene, after she has learned about the trip, she's understandably upset that he didn't tell her about it, but in the space of just a couple of minutes he manipulates her into apologising to _him_. The core of the story is Dani slowly coming to realise that Christian isn't the man she thought he was, and in a weird way, it's a variation on the female revenge genre. However, whereas usually it's revenge for rape or assault, here it's revenge for being a complete and utter dick. In this sense, the film is primarily an allegory for the process of a young woman's emotional/spiritual awakening independent of the man on whom she thought she had to rely. Indeed, one could take this even further if one reads the character names as symbolic; Dani's surname is Ardor, but she is denied love and passion, and in the paganism of the commune, she's offered something she can't get from a self-serving Christian(ity). Whether _Midsommar_ works for you or not will depend largely on how you respond to this element of the story - if you buy into the notion that Christian is the _de facto_ villain, and that Dani is an emotionally scarred young woman looking for support, you'll get a lot more out of it than if you think Dani is a needy whinger and Christian would do well to be rid of her.\r\n\r\nAesthetically, the film looks terrific, with Henrik Svensson's production designer, Andrea Flesch's costume designer, and Pawel Pogorzelski's cinematography especially praiseworthy. Whereas the US scenes are dark and confined, taking place in small poorly lit rooms with the characters wearing drab costumes, once the film shifts to Sweden, the visual design changes completely. The production design emphasises an open-plan vastness with unlimited space to move, but few places to hide; the cinematography drenches everything in glaring sunlight, which, again, makes it hard to hide; and the costume design focuses on brilliant white, with a smattering of colour. Unlike the vast majority of horror movies, there are few shadows or dark corners, but the film is shot in such a way that the very lack of such is itself disconcerting. The same is true for the always pristine costumes, which suggest that something is just not quite right underneath the veneer of cleanliness and insincere sense of perfection. Indeed, the attention to detail in the presentation of the commune is immensely impressive; the long middle act doesn't really feature much in the way of narrative incident, but it sure does a fine job of creating a _milieu_ that feels completely authentic and lived-in.\r\n\r\nThere are also some nice individual moments. For example, the choral singing with which the film begins is harshly interrupted by a telephone ringing, suggesting the clash between tradition and modernity that will play out throughout; Dani's hysterical crying upon learning of her family's deaths blends seamlessly with Bobby Krlic's wonderfully discordant music; a superb single-take shot takes Dani from heading to her apartment bathroom to entering the bathroom of an airplane; a high altitude shot showing a car travelling along a country road is imbued with malevolent undercurrent as the car passes under the camera, but rather than turning around to pick the vehicle up on the reverse angle, the camera follows the car by turning downwards, ending up upside-down, signalling to the viewer that things have changed irrevocably for the characters, as if they have crossed a barrier of some kind.\r\n\r\nIn terms of the narrative design, somewhat unusually, the film wears its predictability on its sleeve, with many of the major narrative beats not only foreshadowed but literally shown to the audience prior to occurring in the story, whether it be the mural that opens the film or the illustrations seen on the walls all over the commune – the _dénouement_ isn't simply hinted at, it's all-but presented to us from the outset. With that in mind, anyone who has seen any folk horror will be able to predict much of what happens. Even if you're only familiar with _The Wicker Man_, you'll still be able to take a decent stab at how things are going to turn out. Of course, this allows the audience to roundly mock the characters' utter obliviousness to what's coming, which is presumably the point. You know that scene in most horror films where you think to yourself \"how can they not realise something nasty is going to happen\"? _Midsommar_ is like a 147-minute version of that one scene.\r\n\r\nAs for the acting, much as _Hereditary_ was Toni Collette's, _Midsommar_ belongs entirely to Florence Pugh, who's going from strength-to-strength at the moment. For most of the film, she's on the precipice of a nervous breakdown, with her performance redolent of Shelley Duval in Stanley Kubrick's _The Shining_ (1980). Pugh has already impressed in films as varied as Carol Morley's _The Falling_ (2014), William Oldroyd's _Lady Macbeth_ (2016), Richard Eyre's _King Lear_ (2018) and Stephen Merchant's _Fighting With My Family_ (2019), but _Midsommar_ is easily her best and most layered performance thus far, especially the gamut of contradictory emotions she runs in the batshit insane last 20 minutes. Elsewhere, the performances are all fine, but the actors aren't helped by the script. As Christian, Jack Reynor plays, well, Jack Reynor. There's nothing really wrong with the performance (although he is the least convincing academic ever put on screen), and he does do a decent job of getting the audience to loathe his passive-aggressive persona, but there isn't a huge amount of depth. The same is true of Will Poulter, who plays Mark as the kind of ignorant sex-crazed loudmouth that seems to only exist in the movies and who is never characterised beyond this caricature. As Josh, William Jackson Harper, although a far more believable academic than Reynor, barely registers, whilst Vilhelm Blomgren's Pelle is so one-note and obviously untrustworthy that it pushes suspension of disbelief to breaking point.\r\n\r\nAs this might suggest, one of the biggest problems with the film is the underwritten characters. This is especially true of Christian, a boyfriend so selfish and uncaring, one wonders how he ever wooed Dani in the first place. Additionally, their relationship is demarcated along painfully stereotypical lines – the emotional female whose need for support becomes overwhelming and the thoughtless bro who is more interested in hanging out with the boys than comforting his girlfriend. Another issue is that even aside from the character of Pelle, the film pushes the suspension of disbelief too far. There are multiple moments when the goings-on in the commune should prompt the visitors to leave immediately, but apart from a few weak attempts by Dani to persuade the others to go, they repeatedly accept the most ridiculous of situations based upon the most tenuous of explanations. Indeed, in a lot of ways, they're no different from the horny idiots who get picked off one by one in so many cheap slasher films. Furthermore, it doesn't help that initially Josh is depicted as an expert on paganism, and is familiar with many aspects of the festival, but later on, the script conveniently forgets about this when necessary.\r\n\r\nThematically, things are also quite jumbled. Whilst the core theme of a toxic relationship is present to one degree or another throughout, and Aster actually has some interesting things to say about complicity in such relationships, a lot of other ideas are thrown into the mix without really going anywhere – death, renewal, paganism itself, the nature of grief (and given the strong opening, that Aster allows this theme to drop off is especially disappointing). Additionally, as already mentioned, there are few surprises here. Aster is obviously a big fan of the subgenre of folk horror, but he allows reverence to the tropes supersede any kind of narrative inventiveness, leading to predictability, and as insane as the last 20 minutes are, nothing really happens that surprised me. Also, as in _Hereditary_, the explanation for what's going on isn't anywhere near as interesting as the ambiguity preceding it, making explicit something which was so deeply unsettling when implicit.\r\n\r\nThat all said, however, I did enjoy _Midsommar_. Not as disturbing as _Herditary_, it finds Aster again working with dread rather than quintessential horror tropes. Aesthetically impressive, and built on a terrific central performance, it could be accused of style over substance or cited as an example of a filmmaker whose ambitions outweigh his abilities, but ultimately, Aster's mastery of tone sees him through. The script could use some work, no doubt, but the ominous sense of dread is palpable throughout and is brilliantly handled, with the most mundane of objects imbued with haunting portentousness. The _dénouement_ is more rote than I expected, and although Aster tries to tackle too many issues, his depiction of the death throes of a toxic relationship is as penetrating and emotionally honest as any ostensible relationship drama. Unnerving and audacious, _Midsommar_ is, ultimately, an exceptionally confident piece of filmmaking, if not necessarily an exceptional piece of filmmaking.",

              "content": "If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)\r\n\r\nThis was easily one of my most anticipated movies of the year. Hereditary was my favorite film of 2018, so obviously, Ari Aster's second feature grabbed my full attention from the very first announcement. Fortunately, even though Midsommar is only being released now in my country, I was able to stay away from spoilers, as well as from any sort of images or clips. As you might expect, this is not a typical horror movie, even though it's being marketed as belonging to the genre. Sure, it has some horror stuff that indisputably connects it to the genre, but it definitely doesn't play out to scare audiences or make you have nightmares at night.\r\n\r\nHereditary was quite divisive among audiences due to the lack of traditional jump scares and generic entertainment, besides it being too excessive regarding spiritualism for the general public. Midsommar is undoubtedly going to be even more divisive. First of all, it drags. There's no denying it. The first weird cult scene only occurs about one hour in, which in a 140-minute runtime is a bit too far ahead. Granted, it's one of the most shocking and horrific sequences in the daylight I've ever seen, but its build-up (extremely well-done) takes a big part of the second act, slowing down the pacing too much.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, it's a film that entirely relies its entertainment value on the feeling of shock instead of fear. If you didn't enjoy Aster's first feature because it didn't have enough scary sequences, Midsommar isn't going to convert you to being a fan of his work. Similarly to Ad Astra (just released last week), it's a story that requires the audience to care about more than only superficial aspects. If you go in expecting to leave your brain outside just so you can be uncloudedly entertained, then you might want to think again. I can't stress this enough: you need to pay attention to what you're watching!\r\n\r\nHints to what the story holds for us are everywhere, especially in the walls. Through paintings, runes, and hand-drawings, Ari Aster spreads basically all the information you need to better understand where the movie is going. It's a film about two key themes: how to deal with grief, and how to handle a complicated relationship. These are the issues that people should be able to acknowledge and understand how they're being developed. I love how Aster addresses the latter topic (he wrote this screenplay after he ended a relationship of his own), but I'm disappointed by the way he put the former into the \"background\".\r\n\r\nThe first 15-20 minutes deal with what happens to Dani's life, and it's never approached again, even though there's a vague idea of what could have actually happened, by the end of the movie. Regarding the other point, it isn't exactly a \"toxic\" relationship that we've seen in previous films, but one where each person is waiting for an excuse to leave the other. Hence, some actions feel forced in the hope that they can trigger something. It's a strangely realistic yet uncomfortable take on something a lot of people go through. Technically, this is one of 2019's most fascinating productions.\r\n\r\nFrom the colorful cinematography to the impeccable editing, from the stunningly impressive production design (again, the WALLS!) to the immersive score … Ari Aster is no joke. The way he handles dialogues is a treat to someone like me, who cares so much about engagement through characters speaking. There are so many long takes with Florence Pugh giving her all, just raw and powerful emotions. It's her career-best performance, no doubt about it. Her character's storyline is partially what brings the \"horror\" to the narrative. Just like Toni Colette on Hereditary, Pugh is probably going to be ignored during the awards season, as well as the movie's technical achievements since the horror genre still didn't convince enough people to give a shot.\r\n\r\nRegarding the other characters, they're my main issue. They simply felt like plot devices. Will Poulter (Mark) is funny as the comic-relief guy, but his character, like every other one besides Dani, doesn't do much to make me care about or feel invested in their own subplots (if there are any). They barely have any backstory, and their purpose is basically to help move the plot forward by giving Aster opportunities to show some pagan rituals of some kind. There are incredibly shocking, bloody, and jaw-dropping scenes, some might make you feel uncomfortable, others might make you laugh. But they're all meant to shock you in some shape or form.\r\n\r\nWhether you love it or hate it, Midsommar is memorable. If you didn't enjoy Hereditary due to the lack of jump scares, the former isn't for you then. Midsommar requires full attention, patience, and an open-minded mentality. It's not a generic horror flick, so don't go in expecting to be constantly entertained by silly scares. Expectations are everything, so moderate them in the best way possible. It has one of the most abstract ways of addressing a difficult relationship and how to deal with grief, but if you LOOK AT THE WALLS, you'll be able to (maybe) follow the story a bit better.\r\n\r\nTechnically, Ari Aster delivers a masterful work, with exceptional production design and gorgeous cinematography, plus seamless editing. Florence Pugh carries the story on her shoulders with an astonishingly compelling performance, but her supporting cast didn't do much with their under-developed characters. The film drags a lot, and it can become tedious at some point, but in the end, it's one of those movies that sticks with you. A second viewing may be necessary, and it will probably be a better experience. Can't wait to find out. Go see it!\r\n\r\nRating: B",

But coming into this on the back of not only the crazy good _Hereditary_ from last year, but also the **gushing** praise from the online horror community, I guess my expectations were a little high. It doesn't make me feel good to say it, but honestly I'm glad I didn't see this in the cinema. Firstly because I think I might've been a little mad if I had forked out $25 to see this, based on the experience I ended up happening, but also secondly, because I don't much feel like going blind in the theatre from the sheer white exposure that takes up 97% of _Midsommar's_ runtime.\r\n\r\n_Final rating:★★½ - Had a lot that appealed to me, didn’t quite work as a whole._",

              "content": "An impressive work, “Midsommar” is Ari Aster’s follow-up to “Herditary,” a decent if flawed horror film.\r\n\r\n“Midsommar” follows Dani, who, after the tragic loss of her parents and sister, decides to follow her increasingly distant boyfriend and his friends on a trip to Sweden to visit the pagan cult commune their roommate, Pelle, grew up in. While seemingly open and friendly, it becomes obvious fairly quickly that something else is going on here. The obvious comparisons to “The Wicker Man” are not uncalled for.\r\n\r\nFirst, in the interest of full disclosure, this review is based on the nearly three-hour Director’s Cut of the film rather than the theatrical release. I haven’t even seen the theatrical release, so I can’t attest as to what was added in the nearly 30 new minutes. I will say that the Director’s Cut is pretty seamless and doesn’t seem to have any superfluous scenes.\r\n\r\nSecond, we need to start with the elephant in the room and address how this compares to “Hereditary,” which as I stated was okay but flawed. The major flaw in that film is that it has its own internal consistency, but doesn’t have consistency from an audience standpoint. There’s only the most minor of hints as to the truth, and it’s clear that in that world, such things were possible, but the audience isn’t really let in on the answer until the end. The audience has to think about it to get that internal logic. I’m usually the type that doesn’t like spoonfeeding information to the audience, but this withheld a little too much.\r\n\r\nOkay, that was “Hereditary.” So how does “Midsommar” compare? Well, it’s far better in terms of letting the audience in on the secret and revealing its internal logic. But, sometimes it’s too good at it. There’s not much of a secret. You know what’s ultimately coming.\r\n\r\nHowever, interestingly this is where the brilliance of the movie actually comes in. Much like life and sex, it’s about the journey, not the destination. We know where we’re going, but the fun is in seeing how we get there. And it’s a fun and colorful journey. This is bright daytime horror, taking place in Sweden at Midsommar when there is very little darkness at night, which itself could be a metaphor in that we can see the end and know where we’re going.\r\n\r\nSo, why only 4 stars? The film is great, but definitely not perfect and has a couple deep flaws. I could give the film a little more credit if it did conceal the end a little more, giving a less obvious “twist.” The other is that it sticks pretty close to traditional character archetypes for horror films. If you don’t know what I mean, this was very well addressed in “Cabin in the Woods.” A little more variety and a little added creativity could have elevated “Midsommar’s” score. While it’s still great, don’t expect a perfect film.",

              "content": "_**“The Wicker Man” meets “The Village”**_\r\n\r\nInvited by their genial Swedish friend, four college students from New York take a vacation to rural Sweden to experience a Midsummer celebration at a commune. A couple of them are cultural anthropology students, who are naturally interested in the friendly isolated group and their odd ceremonies. The situation goes from friendly and curious to shocking. Florence Pugh and Jack Reynor play the American protagonists.\r\n\r\n“Midsommar” (2019) is folk horror that plays out like “The Wicker Man” (1973/2006) meets “The Village” (2004) with elements of “The Lords of Salem” (2012). The topic of visiting a secluded pagan religious community and the increasing challenges thereof can be seen in other flicks like “Ogre” (2008), “The Ritual” (2017) and “Apostle” (2018), as well as the recent Indie “Devil’s Island” (2021). \r\n\r\nIf you like these kinds of movies “Midsommar” delivers the goods.  Writer/director Ari Aster did his homework, combining fact with fiction, old and new. There’s an insightful comparison between the lack of social intimacy in modern Western culture and the family-like camaraderie of the remote Commune. Pugh makes for an effective protagonist and there’s some convincing gore. It’s a professionally made piece no doubt.  \r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the first half is more compelling than the second, which devolves into tedious ceremonies and the corresponding gobbledygook. Hammer’s “The Mummy” (1959) had the same issue but was mercifully an hour shorter. “Midsommar” needed tightened up for a more gripping viewing experience, but directors generally don’t like to cut scenes from their ‘baby.’ \r\n\r\nThe film runs 2 hours, 27 minutes, and was shot in Budakeszi, Hungary (Hårga), as well as Korda Studios, Etyek, and Budapest, Hungary; Dani’s apartment was shot in Brooklyn, New York.\r\n\r\nGRADE: B-",

I really did not-see this coming...**\r\n\r\nThis is one of those horror movies that is actually really deep and symbolical and works on multiple levels and has multiple stories hidden within the surface narrative and in this case it's actually 3 stories that are told at the same time, though only the surface narrative is picked up consciously, the other 2 are picked up subconsciously and that's what makes it disturbing.\r\n\r\nBe sure to watch the extended cut, because only there does it really become apparent what the other 2 stories are about. So, here go the spoilers, cause now I am gonna say what I believe those 3 themes are. Obviously on the surface it's a horror movie, but beneath that it's a drama about relationships and about breaking up - some people pick up on that first hidden theme/narrative and so they find it boring because they expected a horror movie, but what they get is an emotional drama.\r\n\r\nBut no one has consciously picked up on the 3rd narrative - or at least I have never seen anyone mention it - even though it's very obvious when you watch the extended cut. The third genre of movies is that it's a movie about the 3rd Reich and related National Socialist propaganda, ideology and atrocities committed and that's the aspect everyone only picks up subconsciously and that makes everyone feel uncomfortable watching this movie, but without really knowing why.\r\n\r\nWhich also explains some of the criticism, such as Swedes and Pagans complaining that their culture and ideology isn't portrayed accurately. Of course it isn't, because that's not the culture or ideology it's trying to portray! So the 4th and ultimate genre is that it's really a biting political satire that uses all the other genres as cover.\r\n\r\nIt's like the travel movies that the Soviet Union published that make the Soviet Union look like some kind of socialist Disneyland. And as long as you were a tourist who was willing to only go to the places he was told to go and to just gloss over all the labor camps and atrocities, it kinda was! And so what those movies were for socialism, this movie is for National Socialism - a sorta satirical video travel guide into a promised National Socialist fantasy land and Utopian paradise that never existed and that only a complete psychopath could ever try to propagate as something desirable.",

              "content": "**It starts with good premises, but is lost due to a miserable script and a direction that needs direction.**\r\n\r\nAri Aster is not a director that I consider good. This is his second feature film, and he didn't show great talent for directing here. However, worse than his direction is his absolute lack of writing skills: the script he wrote here is mediocre, to be nice, and completely kills the film.\r\n\r\nWhat I liked most about this film was the extraordinary cinematography, full of color and light and joy that makes us feel the warmth and natural vibrancy of the beginning of Summer. By largely setting his film in a rural ambience, Aster was almost able to demonize urban life, portraying urban environments as gloomy, dark, sinister and depressing. In fact, he even creates a link between the main character's agony and the depressive environments of urban life: there is not a sole positive or warm image before the characters set foot on the fields of Sweden... or rather Hungary, the country where most of the filming took place, perhaps taking advantage of the tax benefits that were given to foreign film productions there.\r\n\r\nThe sets and costumes could not be more appealing, especially to audiences who are already interested in Nordic traditions, witchcraft, Wicca or new age paganism: we have runes, we have hippie-style flowers in their hair, we have people in white and barefoot dancing around poles, we have fertile and sexually desirable youngsters, we have the recreational and ritualistic consumption of drugs and hallucinogens, we have happy people living in a community, with no private property and in polyamory... it seems like a John Lennon dream. This is beautiful, attractive and seductive in the same way that it is unbelievable and contradicts the basic human instincts: the appetite for violence and the desire to have things. Unfortunately, and largely due to a poorly written script, the film is no more than that. The director/screenwriter was unable to give the film a conclusion or create a credible threat. Clearly inspired by another film (“The Wicker Man”), it lacks a good ending, there are too many stupid scenes (for example, when one of the characters cries heartlessly and is surrounded by a choir that almost turns it into a song) and there are too many loose ends in this story, which becomes more and more idiotic. To make everything more ignoble, there is a subliminal anti-Christian message that becomes clear when we see that the most vilified character is named Christian...\r\n\r\nThe actors are not to blame for the misery that this film was. Florence Pugh is the actress who stands out the most and does the most interesting work, but Vilhelm Blomgren also offers us a well-done performance. Will Poulter, one of the actors I know best here, seems underutilized, with a character that only appears occasionally and is irrelevant to the plot. William Harper also does what he can, but he doesn't have the space or material to show what he's worth. In the European cast, Isabelle Grill and Gunnel Fred are the actresses who deserve the most attention: each of them, in their own way, tried to be mysterious and unsettling, and they achieved this in the way they had imagined.",

              "content": "After a delay lasting 19 months; the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) has returned to the big screen with “Black Widow”. The film takes place between “Captain America: Civil War” and “Avengers: Infinity War”; audiences get more of the backstory of Natasha Romanoff (Scarlett Johansson), as we are introduced to her early life before the Red Room.\r\n\r\nThis is not to say that the film is an origin story as it uses her backstory through a clever introduction that establishes her “family” as sleeper agents in Ohio before they escape and she and her cover sister are tuned over for conditioning and training.\r\n\r\nSince Natasha is on the run from the authorities; she finds a remote location in Norway to bide her time. This does not last as a dangerous adversary known as the Taskmaster arrives and sets a chain of events into motion.\r\n\r\nNatasha has been sent a package from her cover sister Yelena (Florence Pugh) who also went through the Red Room and became a top assassin in the years since she and Natasha last saw one another.\r\n\r\nDespite her mixed feelings; Natasha ventures to Budapest and confronts Yelena who in turn reveals the package she sent her contains a compound that can free the other Black Widows from the control of the Red Room which despite Natasha’s insistence is still very much alive as is the head of the institute which she is convinced she killed long ago.\r\n\r\nWith Taskmaster and other Widows hot on their trail, Natasha and Yelena are forced to seek the help of their former “Father” the imprisoned hero Red Guardian (David Harbour), and their cover Mother Melina (Rachel Weisz), to find the location of the new Red Room; free the Widows, and end the program once and for all.\r\n\r\nWhat follows is an engaging story with solid action and effects that remains at its core a character story as Natasha attempts to reconcile her cover family with her new Avengers family and the pain of her upbringing and conditioning.\r\n\r\nMarvel resisted calls from some to release the film on Disney+ last year when the Pandemic caused multiple delays to the planned release dates. This decision to me was very wise as this is a film that needs to be seen and heard on the big screen as it is an experience that is best experienced in a cinema with others.\r\n\r\nWhile many attempts were made over the decades to adapt comic heroes to film and television; most of them came up lacking and disappointed fans of the source material. Marvel for over a decade has continued to succeed as they have a clear plan, cast well, and have engaging characters that develop over time.\r\n\r\n“Black Widow” fills in a missing gap of time in the MCU well and also sets up future adventures as a scene in the credits clearly links two of the live-action Disney+ series and shows that the long-term plan for the MCU continues and incorporates the film and television series well.\r\n\r\nFrom the moment the Marvel intro and music appeared on the screen until the very end; “Black Widow” was a very enjoyable and engaging blockbuster adventure that shows Marvel at the top of their game; and why they continue to set event-level movies not to miss.\r\n4 stars out of 5",

              "content": "FULL SPOILER-FREE REVIEW @ https://www.msbreviews.com/movie-reviews/black-widow-spoiler-free-review\r\n\r\n\"Black Widow beautifully honors the iconic Natasha Romanoff, who finally receives the respectful, worthy solo film that her unforgettable legacy always deserved. Cate Shortland and Eric Pearson put together an MCU installment that doesn't really compare to any of the other origin flicks, profoundly examining the protagonist's dark past and her complex \"family\" through distinctly compelling storytelling. Scarlett Johansson shines one last time, interpreting the most impactful role of her career, but Florence Pugh comes close to stealing the spotlight by giving an absolutely phenomenal display. Boasting highly entertaining, mostly well-filmed action sequences, the main narrative follows a path with no surprises, as well as a generic villain, but the emotionally investing storylines regarding Natasha's personal motivations and Yelena's complex feelings keep the film remarkably captivating. The ending is as satisfying as I could have ever wished for. A loving farewell to a hero that inspired millions of viewers.\"\r\n\r\nRating: A-",

She was brilliant in action sequences and I like the fun elements in her character. Yelena and Natasha's chemistry was too good. David Harbour also performed very well. \r\n\r\nThe action sequences were good but CGI was too weak in the 3d act. Also, I didn't like the changes in Natasha's character. She has no superpowers like other avengers. Her strong brain and mind combine to make her a lethal weapon but they showed her over powerful in this movie. \r\n\r\nThe inner wounds of Natasha were beautifully delivered in this movie. I liked the movie but because of Florence only.",

              "content": "Subpar Bond that believes it has emotional stakes isn't exactly a very winning formula. Far too much bad MCU banter to go with something that wants to be grounded and quite frankly none of the actors are quite adapt at those sitcomy whedonisms that these movies made mainstream (Pugh in particular is terrible at those bits). Some of the mid section action is better than average as far as those movies goes but anything with Taskmasker is very bad and the big end is terrible. Winstone villain made me miss when people like Lonsdale and Lee made lousy Moore Bond plots half watchable. The major limitation is that far too much of the emotional beats depend on what characters talk about their time together when they were a pretend family and altough Johansson and Pugh have good chemistry and Weisz and Harbour do as good job as possible under the circunstances of selling their regrets, there just isn't enough downtime between plot needs to anything of it truly land. I can get what Shortland was hoping to import into one of those but little actually works even with the benefit of a far more standalone movie than most of them. Also, strange how after a decade of postponing giving Johansson her movie, they did one in which she so often feels like a witness/connective MCU tissue for the main supporting characters family drama that they had to give her an extra subplot with her guilty over \"killing\" Winstone's daughter so it can feel like she has more material to work with. She is both the lead and the most extraneous part of her own movie",

However, after seeing the deep dives into characters that had been on the sidelines for years, this movie felt very surface level of the complexity of Natasha Romanoff. She was taken as a child to learn how to be an assassin, she had to sacrifice her morals to leave her past behind, she basically remained an assassin for a different organization that turned out to be run by similarly bad people as those she left, and she is now on the run from the government that once hailed her a hero because she didn’t fall in line. Oh, and she is reconnecting with her past fake family that gave her and Yelena back to the Red Room as soon as the mission was over. The trauma this character endured would’ve been better explored as a mini series, rather than a movie that’s trying to simultaneously remind us of where Natasha was five years ago and also trying not to acknowledge that Natasha has no risk posed to her in this movie because we know she lives on past these events. However, very excited to see where Yelena goes in the future.",

Everything else about Black Widow feels like it was done better by the films it was supposedly influenced by and mostly feels like a diluted imitation of Captain America: The Winter Soldier. It’s fantastic that women are getting more opportunities in big summer blockbusters like this one, but it’s also disheartening since their filmmaking skills are shackled to formulaic superfluity that obviously stands in the way of creating extraordinary cinema. \r\n\r\nFull review: https://geekshavegame.com/black-widow-review-espionage-exhaustion/",

              "content": "**Black Widow is a decent MCU film with excellent entertaining characters but an average to disappointing story.**\r\n\r\nBlack Widow faced steep expectations as Marvel's first female-led film focused on a cherished MCU favorite. Black Widow's past was always shrouded in mystery and pain, but she was finally receiving the attention the hero deserved to dive into her past and celebrate Scarlett Johansson's super spy. With hopes high and fans wanting a Captain America: The Winter Soldier-type superhero espionage film, Black Widow, unfortunately, fell short. Nothing was particularly disappointing about the film. I had just hoped for so much more for the character and Scarlett Johansson at this point in the MCU's journey. The effects and action were decent. The villain was forgettable. The big defining Budapest incident was passed by with hardly any impact or emotional weight. Black Widow gets lost in all of the chaos of the film. The best part of the movie by far was the new characters played by Florence Pugh and David Harbor. They were highly entertaining, funny, and endearing. I hope to see Florence Pugh's Yelena Belova in many more Marvel films. Black Widow really was a decent entry in the Marvel universe and one of the better Phase 4 movies. Still, it didn't do Natasha Romanoff the justice she deserved leaving the character's best moments in other Marvel films that focused on other heroes.",

No knowledge of the Avengers is required to watch this film, although, in a Marvel context, it happens after the civil war breaks up the Avengers of which Natasha was a part of. Effects and tension are amazing to watch and edge of seat but there's a payoff with plot. A familiar action film formula – _get and protect the MacGuffin while getting to the evil megalomaniac before he takes over the world_. The formula acts as a vehicle for pretty much non-stop action. If that’s enough for you then this is might be your perfect film.  The familial relationships and confronting her dark past promised in the advert don’t really deliver (although Natasha’s sister, Yelena is essential to this film) but if two hours of Scarlett Johansson kicking high-octane butt is your thing then you’re in for a treat. Too heavy on the action but fun to watch. 6/10",

Der Film zeigt auch, dass das MCU immer und immer wieder mit schwachen Antagonisten zu kämpfen hat, was bei einem Film, der weniger von seiner coolen Action, als vielmehr von seiner Story lebt einfach noch mehr ins Gewicht fällt. Ja, die Actionszenen des Films sind gut. Florence Pugh fügt sich als Schwester von Black Widow gut in das Universum ein und es ist auch schön mehr über die Vorgeschichte von Black Widow zu erfahren. Am Ende muss man allerdings auch sagen, dass Black Widow kein guter Film ist. Dafür überwiegen leider die genannten Schwächen zu sehr und Marvel hat zuletzt mit seinen starken Serien bewiesen, dass sie auch storylastigere Geschichten packend erzählen können. [Sneakfilm.de]",

              "content": "So imagine the scenario. A boozy lunch with with some screenwriters who had just seen \"Vivarium\" (2019) and began to recall \"Stepford Wives\" (2004) and the \"Truman Show\" (1998). We know, say the assembled talent - let's write a pointless hybrid of these stories, making sure to avoid the best bits of any of them then get two gorgeous people to take part. We'll end up minted! Well they may well have ended up making loads of cash, but what they have provided for us is an heavily stylised story that goes nowhere fast. To be fair, Florence Pugh tries quite hard as \"Alice\", the increasingly disturbed wife of \"Jack\" (Harry Styles). They live in an Utopian desert community where the men all head to work for \"Frank\" (Chris Pine) in the morning and the women do the standard middle class housework, shopping and networking things. All is idyllic until \"Alice\" notices that one of their neighbours \"Margaret\" (KiKi Layne) is convinced that something is amiss amidst their perfect lifestyle. When an inexplicable tragedy ensues, \"Alice\" starts to have nightmares and soon her marriage and his career prospects are in jeopardy. Pine isn't the least menacing as the duplicitous \"Frank\" and though the camera really does love Styles, he has little here to demonstrate whether he can actually act or can just fill a perfectly tailored suit as well as Daniel Craig. That's really the problem here. The film looks good, but the plot is completely undercooked. We are delivered of a partially formed plot that is derivative and, frankly, rather dull. The last few scenes with the guys in red reminded me of a television commercial for Vodaphone and at just over two hours long, I was just unengaged with it all. Styles' looks will take him far and working with the likes of Pugh and Pine will only help him, but unless his people work harder on the scripts and characterisations, then he will just end up Zac Efron-light. This is a film for television in due course, I'd say.",

This is only the third film of her's that I've seen... gotta watch more!\r\n\r\nAway from Pugh, I was impressed by Harry Styles. He can act. I will say, though, that Shia LaBeouf would've been greater in the role though. Elsewhere, Olivia Wilde (also dir.), Chris Pine and Gemma Chan do good things.\r\n\r\nIs it a perfect film? Not at all.

              "content": "It is no surprise that _Don't Worry Darling_ has been marred with public controversies and poor critic reception, but is it really bad as the media would want you to believe? While I admit, there are plenty of issues in the story department, like completely abandoning certain plot details as they are introduced or leaving certain character plots half-baked to name a few, the other aspects of this film really make this an enjoyable viewing experience.\r\n\r\nOlivia Wilde's direction is actually really well done here. I could tell that certain shots and elements were done with the specific intent to create a romanticized version of the 1950's while still giving glimpses of something sinister hidden underneath. Although it is a shame that these elements didn't lead to much in terms of a reveal at the end.\r\n\r\nThe acting is a mixed bag here. Florence Pugh and Chris Pine absolutely carry this film. Pugh carries such complex emotions and is able to show her internal struggles while putting on a pretty face for appearance sakes. It is captivating and the audience can completely be resonant with her, this connection makes her character easy to root for. Chris Pine was really sinister in this role. I have not seen him as a villain in many shows and he does a fantastic job. For whatever reason, his mannerisms really reminded me of James Spader in Avengers: Age of Ultron, and that is a complement. Pine was not giving much screen time or character development, but he does the most with what he has. Olivia Wildes was fine, do not really have any complaints really, wasn't great but wasn't bad. Harry Styles' performance is hard to pinpoint. While I don’t think he did bad, but when he is constantly sharing the screen with Pughe, he is overshadowed a lot and his deficiencies show much more.\r\n\r\nOverall, I was disappointed with _Don't Worry Darling_ and the potential that was there to be such a special film. But it was still a good film that I had a fun time in.\r\n\r\n**Score:** _69%_\r\n**Verdict:** _Good_",

In the case of Don't Worry Darling, one finishes it with an underwhelming feeling from an unsurprising conclusion, while in Crimes of the Future, viewers are left with several questions and interesting, half-developed paths about such a mesmerizing futuristic world.\r\n\r\nNeither film explores its own world-building satisfactorily.\"\r\n\r\nRating: B-",

But all that is lost in a script that gets stuck on coming up with as many ways as possible to show its characters' slipping sanity rather than telling a complete story. The plot twists were pretty easy to guess, and the finale ended abruptly without providing any conclusion or resolution for the character. With all the bright spots this film had to offer, the sloppy story squandered all its high points leaving me let down and a little bored even with an exciting climax. With that said, I'm still trying to figure out what could have been done to make this story more compelling.

              "content": "**By: Louisa Moore / www.ScreenZealots.com**\r\n\r\n“Don’t Worry Darling” isn’t the massive mess that so many predicted, but it does suffer from a few major problems. The script (written by Katie Silberman) lacks grace and polish, one star’s questionable acting skills is amplified by the other lead’s performance, and Olivia Wilde‘s direction is noticeably weak. But there’s still something mesmerizing about this feminist-tinged film and its commentary on the supposed ideals of a patriarchal society.\r\n\r\nAlice (Florence Pugh) and Jack (Harry Styles) live a charmed life in the experimental utopia known as Victory. The town is exclusively for employees of the top-secret Victory Project and their families, and it’s truly the most perfect place in the world — or so it seems. Company CEO Frank (Chris Pine) is the visionary behind it all, a stylish, confident leader whom the men all want to emulate. He provides everything the town’s residents need, asking only for loyalty and obedience in return.\r\n\r\nVictory is a place that embodies the idyllic 1950s life, where the women cook and clean, dress to perfection, and spend their free time day drinking, lounging by the pool, and gossiping with friends. The men fulfill their role in this society too, by going to work at the mysterious headquarters and returning like clockwork in the evenings. It’s a don’t ask, don’t tell type of community, until Alice begins having strange, nightmarish visions. She begins to explore the more sinister side of Victory, hoping to eventually expose what’s really going on beneath the facade of domestic bliss.\r\n\r\nThe plot is one that’s been done before, and there isn’t much by way of originality. What makes the first part of the film so successful is that the story is told from the point of view of the women in town. By presenting the narrative through the lens of an army of happy homemaker wives, there’s an ominous tone throughout — especially when the ladies in town turn to self-harm in order to take back control of their lives.\r\n\r\nAlice is a strong female character, and Pugh proves yet again that she’s one of the most exciting talents working in Hollywood today. Much is asked of her and she is up to the task of doing the heavy lifting here, especially in her many scenes with Styles. To put it bluntly, Pugh acts Styles under the table and then some. I believe the film would have been more successful with a more talented leading man.\r\nWhen the ending finally comes through a long drawn out reveal, it’s a letdown that feels like an episode of “Black Mirror.” If you examine some of the film’s earlier scenes, the story doesn’t feel quite as airtight as it should.\r\n\r\nThe themes are excessive and overdone, presenting the conservative male ideal of relationships and life. It’s a chilling statement about women’s rights and responsibilities, and men’s desire to control and dominate. The timing for this message couldn’t be more perfect with the tumultuous political climate that’s spreading around the world. As a woman, I appreciate the sentiment of “Don’t Worry Darling” and the feminist lens in which its presented, but I just wish the film had been more successful overall.",

              "content": "**Spoilers**\r\n\r\nThe live action remake of \"Beauty and the Beast\" was good, but it failed to capture the magic of the cartoon version. There were somethings that they got right, and others that dragged on.\r\n\r\nI thought \"Be Our Guest\" was done beautifully. The 3d made it even more enchanting. The main characters' backstories also added some depth to them. However, there were some scenes that I felt added nothing to the story. Such as the search for Belle by Gaston and her father. The \"No one is like Gaston\" scene didn't have the bravado or arrogance of the original.\r\n\r\nI also felt that Luke Evans was miscast. He wasn't the handsomest guy in town, nor was he the strongest. Which is why it was hard for me to accept him as the character. Emma Watson was serviceable. Her voice was fine, but it wasn't strong enough to carry Belle's songs. Dan Stevens was the best part of the film. I felt that he should have had more songs, because he has a beautiful baritone. Although his beast costume should have been more frightening. \r\n\r\nOverall, it's a fun film to watch. Though, I wouldn't call it a classic.",

Mine was the animated one and then there was a modern-day version called 'Beastly'. Not to forget there's a recent French version made on the big scale that I yet to watch. So it's not about the story at all. It is about the quality of film, performances, and particularly how the modern technology used to narrate the story.\r\n\r\nLike the recent Disney's live-actions 'Cinderella', 'The BFG', 'The Jungle Book' and many more, this is another excellently adapted film from the book. Though visually it tried to be true to the original, and that's absolutely great thinking. Because in this modern world, we all try something new out of the original contents for sometimes to mess it up.\r\n\r\nExcellent casting, the beauty was the best pick among all. The graphics were awesome. The CGI beast was flawless, yet that usual dark and cloudy atmosphere helped it to be so perfect. Since it is listed under Musical, I was worried about the songs. I truly don't like modern Musicals. But this film was not completely filled with songs. Yes, there were like half a dozen, but good ones. Retained the songs from the 1991 film, and in addition three new were composed.\r\n\r\nI did not think the Disney would get away with consecutive successes. Great achievement, and their attempts were very precautionary on their every step. Now this is Disney's second highest grossed film ever and first in live-action. The film was for all ages unlike old Disney films. That's the best thing about the modern Disney films that they have adopted. Definitely recommended for at least once watch it.\r\n\r\n_8/10_",

The scale of the tiny claustrophobic village contrasted with the grandiose halls of the enchanted clearly presents the different worlds of the main characters despite grappling with the same loneliness. The cast has two major standouts in Luke Evans’ Gaston and Ewan McGregor’s Lumière.

Again, it works spectacularly as a piece of cinematic innovation - but has no spirit. We know the story: a vain Prince is cursed by a sorceress to remain shut up, hideously disfigured, in his castle until the spell is broken by true love's tear. \"Belle\" (Emma Watson) does well to keep this almost Ziegfeld-esque extravaganza on track. She manages to avoid the amorous intentions of Luke Evans as \"Gaston\" before ending up doing the prisoner swap for her father in the castle of the Prince - an extremely well made up Dan Stevens. The additional voice cast line up is great - Kevin Kline, Sir Ian McKellan, Ewan McGregor, Emma Thompson and Stanley Tucci. The songs are reprised from the 1991 version of the story but without the charm and mischief of their original iterations; they are just too precise and dare I say \"professional\". The technology has now super-subsumed every element of the process to the point that it is almost clinically delivered. The characters and story are still great, but please, Disney, leave something a little rough around the edges for us....",

              "content": "It is the quality of one's convictions that determines success, not the number of followers. \r\n\r\nSo here it is, the 8th and final instalment of a film franchise that has lasted 10 years and runs at just under 20 hours in total. Following straight on from the frustratingly incomplete scene setter that was Deathly Hallows Part 1, we continue to track Harry, Hermione and Ron as they search for the remaining Horcruxes that will render the evil Lord Voldermort as a mere mortal. This narrative thread is run concurrently with the Voldermort movements, where he now has in his possession The Elder Wand (the wand to rule them all) and has gathered a vast army to descend upon Hogwarts and achieve his ultimate goal of killing Harry. Meanwhile vital character story arcs are filled in and secrets will out...\r\n\r\nDavid Yates directs and Steve Kloves adapts to the screen, both of whom were perfect choices given their considerable input to the series. Smartly the pic has been kept to a 2 hour and 10 minute run time, and thankfully it flows nicely and the pace never stalls. Being one of those who has never read the books I can't say what has been left out or if anything has been tampered with for dramatic licence? What I know for sure is that the emotional investment garnered from being with this story for so long, to be part of these characters lives, watching them grow, ensures that this closure piece pounds the senses. Sitting down to watch it you realise that we are going to lose people we care for, and Hogwarts, the wonderful place we fist glimpsed across the night time water, is going to be attacked and reduced to a battle scarred place of war.\r\n\r\nAs the effects work dazzles and the one time child actors come shining through as mature actors who have casted off previous wooden traits, the story filling strands show just what wonderful work Rowling achieved on the page. Some of the characters never stood a chance in life, some carried deep emotional scars, and others  held secrets so crucial to the whole Potter universe. For a series of such fantastical genre sparkle, the Harry Potter world eventually reveals itself to be a deep and fortified humanist drama, and engaging it most certainly is. That this is achieved as battlefield carnage is raised, with wand wars booming up on the screen, it means credit is due to all involved the making of such a cherished and intensely followed Octalogy.\r\n\r\nIs it the earth shattering finale one hoped for? Well not quite. Story wise for sure that is the case, but with the whole story driving towards the final battle between Harry and Voldermort, it's disappointing to find it's rather brief and in truth anti climatic. Harry the boy now burgeoning into a man versus the snake faced despot surely should have been a crowning glory, but sadly not so. To compound this irritating disappointment, we then get the epilogue that is bogged down by aging make-up design that is almost laughable. But these are just annoyances, not film killers, for this has been a magical ride for 10 years. Fans will feel a gap in the heart now it's over, maybe even shed a Snape like tear as well? Yet ultimately it has been a triumph and the rewatchable factor for the whole series will always remain high. 8/10",

              "content": "It is the quality of one's convictions that determines success, not the number of followers. \r\n\r\nSo here it is, the 8th and final instalment of a film franchise that has lasted 10 years and runs at just under 20 hours in total. Following straight on from the frustratingly incomplete scene setter that was Deathly Hallows Part 1, we continue to track Harry, Hermione and Ron as they search for the remaining Horcruxes that will render the evil Lord Voldermort as a mere mortal. This narrative thread is run concurrently with the Voldermort movements, where he now has in his possession The Elder Wand (the wand to rule them all) and has gathered a vast army to descend upon Hogwarts and achieve his ultimate goal of killing Harry. Meanwhile vital character story arcs are filled in and secrets will out...\r\n\r\nDavid Yates directs and Steve Kloves adapts to the screen, both of whom were perfect choices given their considerable input to the series. Smartly the pic has been kept to a 2 hour and 10 minute run time, and thankfully it flows nicely and the pace never stalls. Being one of those who has never read the books I can't say what has been left out or if anything has been tampered with for dramatic licence? What I know for sure is that the emotional investment garnered from being with this story for so long, to be part of these characters lives, watching them grow, ensures that this closure piece pounds the senses. Sitting down to watch it you realise that we are going to lose people we care for, and Hogwarts, the wonderful place we fist glimpsed across the night time water, is going to be attacked and reduced to a battle scarred place of war.\r\n\r\nAs the effects work dazzles and the one time child actors come shining through as mature actors who have casted off previous wooden traits, the story filling strands show just what wonderful work Rowling achieved on the page. Some of the characters never stood a chance in life, some carried deep emotional scars, and others held secrets so crucial to the whole Potter universe. For a series of such fantastical genre sparkle, the Harry Potter world eventually reveals itself to be a deep and fortified humanist drama, and engaging it most certainly is. That this is achieved as battlefield carnage is raised, with wand wars booming up on the screen, it means credit is due to all involved in the making of such a cherished and intensely followed Octalogy.\r\n\r\nIs it the earth shattering finale one hoped for? Well not quite. Story wise for sure that is the case, but with the whole story driving towards the final battle between Harry and Voldermort, it's disappointing to find it's rather brief and in truth anti climatic. Harry the boy now burgeoning into a man versus the snake faced despot surely should have been a crowning glory, but sadly not so. To compound this irritating disappointment, we then get the epilogue that is bogged down by aging make-up design that is almost laughable. But these are just annoyances, not film killers, for this has been a magical ride for 10 years. Fans will feel a gap in the heart now it's over, maybe even shed a Snape like tear as well? Yet ultimately it has been a triumph and the rewatchable factor for the whole series will always remain high. 8/10",

              "content": "I can only marvel at the imagination of JK Rowling as this final instalment of our 10 year journey with Harry, Ron and Hermione reaches a fitting climax. Still continuing on their search for the remaining horcruxes, they must use all of their skills and intrepidity before \"Voldemort\" finally returns to wreak havoc on their (and our) world. Radcliffe, Grint and Watson are very much comfortable in the parts now and that shows - their confidence and assuredness adds bundles to the cracking script and well paced direction from David Yates. Not just the three stars, but others we have seen for many of the series come into their own - Dame Maggie Smith (\"Prof. McGonagall\") gets some wand action, as does Julie Walters with a cracking duel with Helena Bonham-Carter's \"Bellatrix Lestrange\"; the magical effects are superb and the multiple threads all tie together well. Did it need to be two films? I suspect that the audience probably benefited from this in two instalments, but a director's cut of the whole thing in one fell swoop could make for an epic piece of cinema. Great stories, characters and a vivid imagination - a most enjoyable ride!",

It's no longer a cheesy, children's franchise - but a dark, gritty and thoughtful piece of work from David Yates that really does convey some of the sinister and malevolent aspects of JK Rowling's book. Harry, Ron and Hermione are all but grown up - whether they are old enough, or not - and with their friends and allies must now prepare for the final battle with \"Voldemort\". This involves the seeking out and destruction of the crucial horcruxes that each contain a part of the life-force of their evil foe. The writing is taut, as is the direction - the personalities of the three characters we have followed for the last 9 years have developed into plausible people - with quirks, strengths, weaknesses - and (sadly) even romantic tendencies. It's fantastic cinema, with captivating visual effects, characterisations and a much more mature storyline that deals with both triumph and disaster using a superb ensemble cast drawn from amongst the best actors who all contribute to build a real sense of unity and jeopardy ahead of part 2.... One for the big screen, definitely...",

              "content": "Never stop fighting till the fight is done, here endeth the lesson.\r\n\r\nAs good a gangster movie that has ever been made as DePalma does justice to Mamet's electric script. The acting on show is right out of the top draw, the inevitable ease that DeNiro puts menace into Capone is quite impressive, whilst the fresh faced pugnacious tenacity of Andy Garcia's George Stone is something of a delightful experience. Yet that is not enough because we still need the central actors to carry the film if it is going to triumph. Connery is a given performance wise (accent aside of course, but then again who cares when the character portrayal is as sharp as it is here?) but it is Costner as Eliot Ness that shines like the star he was soon to become, it's a magic performance that manages to fuse genuine tenderness of family love with little trips to the dark side in pursuit of making good triumph over evil.\r\n\r\nI love that the film is showing how violence and fear affects families, mother and child is a theme that is central to the film's heartbeat, notice how some of the more violent scenes are followed by tender scenes of Ness and his family. The set pieces here are attention grabbing entertainment, a roaring Canadian border rumpus and a smashing roof top pursuit and face off are top value, but it's DePalma gold watching a brilliant Battleship Potemkin homage at the Union train station that takes the cake as the film enters the last quarter. Surely historical facts does not matter when films are as sharp as this one is?. It's frightening, touching, and even witty. So for me at least, the film is 10/10 in every department (and yes, even with Sean's accent).\r\n\r\nFootnote: The academy saw fit to nominate Ennio Morricone for his wonderful score, yet strangely he used some of it for the main theme in John Carpenter's 1982 film \"The Thing\", they must have missed it that time I presume! Must be the genre angle one thinks...",

              "content": "If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog @\r\nhttps://www.msbreviews.com\r\n\r\nCapone starring Tom Hardy is being released this week, so I decided to visit a classic from the late 80s that also features Al Capone (this time portrayed by Robert De Niro). One of my 2020's resolutions is to review older films, classics that I never wrote about, and maybe go through a director's filmography before his/her next big movie. I'll also try to review previous films inside a franchise, for example, before the live-action Mulan is released, I'll definitely rewatch and review the 1998's original. You get my point.\r\n\r\nThe Untouchables is one of those classics I've already seen a few times, but I can't quite recall the last time I watched it, so it almost felt like a whole new release since I didn't remember most plot points. I really enjoyed experiencing such a great period gangster movie again. The cast is incredible, and I'll get there, but I need to start with the impressive production level for a 1987's flick. From the set design to the well-crafted action sequences, everything looks and feels like Chicago during the Prohibition Era.\r\n\r\nI love how the dialogues are played out. Nowadays, it's not that common to have an entire film filled with long, uncut conversations between the characters. Most directors just employ the unimaginative \"line-cut-line\" type of dialogue. I'm not the biggest fan of Brian DePalma, even though he started one of my favorite action sagas of all-time (Mission: Impossible). However, his blocking/framing skills are outstanding in this movie. Every actor's movement is followed seamlessly by the camera (DP: Stephen H. Burum), making every single shot count.\r\n\r\nThe screenplay is very well-structured. Every time the film starts lacking energy, something impactful occurs. A great action scene, a new story development that changes the course of the narrative, or a character's decision that makes the viewer worried about an inevitable outcome. Consequently, The Untouchables rarely loses its momentum, it's always entertaining in some shape or form. The four characters that constitute the title group are all emotionally compelling, and their actors offer extraordinary performances... except for the lead, Kevin Costner.\r\n\r\nI don't know if people might consider this a hot take or not, but I find Costner's display extremely one-dimensional. During the movie, he goes through life-threatening situations, people that he cares about die, and he eventually gets face-to-face with Al Capone. His facial expression looks awkwardly almost identical in all of these scenes, and many more. It's his first big film, the one that catapulted him into stardom, but I'm not the first to find his acting rangeless in this flick. Nevertheless, it doesn't become that big of a distraction that I can't connect with his character.\r\n\r\nRegarding the rest of the cast, Sean Connery steals the show with his portrayal of Jim Malone. He's charming and funny, but when he needs to take his character through a very dark and dramatic scene, he has no problems in delivering an exceptional performance. The young Andy Garcia (George Stone) proves that he had the chops to become a great actor (which he did), and Charles Martin Smith is surprisingly witty as Oscar Wallace. My main issue with the movie involves the lack of screentime given to Robert De Niro as Al Capone.\r\n\r\nSure, it's a story about the people who got the famous gangster, and not a biography of the latter. However, not only it's a waste of a phenomenal actor, but also a waste of a potentially great character. Al Capone is supposedly a quite clever businessman and ruthless crime boss, possessing an unusually well-protected organization, but he only appears in a few scattered scenes, like he's just some random villain that the good guys need to defeat. Granted, they're really cool scenes, but he doesn't feel like the massive threat that the film assumes he is since the viewer barely gets to know Al Capone and how he holds so much power.\r\n\r\nAll in all, The Untouchables still holds up incredibly well after more than thirty years. Production-wise, not only the sets and costumes seamlessly resemble the Prohibition Era, but Brian DePalma's technically impressive blocking and framing are a joy to watch. Long, captivating, uncut dialogues are elevated by a remarkable cast (Sean Connery is undoubtedly the standout), despite Kevin Costner lacking a bit of emotional range. Even the action sequences of this 1987's movie look better than a lot of blockbusters of today. David Mamet writes a well-structured screenplay that rarely loses interest and featuring exceptionally compelling characters. Addictive score from Ennio Morricone as well. However, both Robert De Niro and his character, Al Capone, are underused, especially the latter. For such an important character who constantly changes the path of the narrative, the lack of screentime doesn't allow the viewer to understand Al Capone's motivations or feel how much of a threat he truly is. Still, it's a classic worthy of a rewatch, and I definitely recommend it.\r\n\r\nRating: A-",

That said, _Dances with Wolves_ is not really in my wheelhouse, and although it held my attention I can't see myself probably ever watching it again. Costner knows what he's about, and that's great, but a four-hour film about American history with strong romance elements is never going to blow me away.\r\n\r\n_Final rating:★★★ - I liked it. Would personally recommend you give it a go._",

              "content": "There are two actor of recent years that I really struggle with. One is Tom Hanks, the other is Kevin Costner. His monotonic narrative as he conveys this story via his journal makes this otherwise breathtakingly beautiful story frequently a real plod. He is \"Lt. Dunbar\" who after a very close shave with the Confederate troops during the US Civil War is posted to a far outpost where he finds himself living a solitary existence with only a wolf (\"Two Socks\") for company. That is until a passing warrior gets a glimpse of him at his bath and runs a mile. What now ensues is a gently paced story depicting his developing relationship with his neighbouring Sioux tribe. This film features a memorable John Barry score to accompany some fine cinematography, and the efforts from Graham Greene (\"Kicking Bird\") and a slew of other native American actors is excellent. It's just Kevin. He was the power being the production, and certainly had some skill directing it - but his acting... It is so soporific. He simply doesn't convey well the senses of loneliness, fear and joy that his character experiences as he gradually becomes subsumed into a new - sometimes rather brutal - identity. The story demonstrates and exposes the prevailing attitudes of both cultures towards the other, of their suspicions and mistrust - and were the \"Dunbar\" role to have been portrayed by a more heavyweight screen presence, then we could have had a memorable movie rather than just a long one. It is still good, though - just could have been doing with more oomph from the star.",

It stars Kevin Costner, Dennis Hopper, Jeanne Tripplehorn, Tina Majorino, Michael Jeter and Gerard Murphy. Music is scored by James Newton Howard and cinematography by Dean Semler.\r\n\r\nIt's the future and the polar ice caps have melted and the Earth is practically covered by the sea. As civilisation is forced to live on the water, their only hope is to one day find the fabled place known as Dryland. A Mariner drifter may hold the key to Dryland's whereabouts...\r\n\r\nIt was by definition a troubled shoot, with sackings, difference of opinions, cost overruns, production set backs (hurricane destroying a hugely expensive set) and bad word of mouth generated by a film press intent on giving Kevin Costner a good kicking. Facts are, now that all the water has evaporated over the years, Waterworld is neither the flop or the bad film that many believed it to be. Should it be a better movie considering the gargantuan amounts of cash spent on it? Absolutely, without question! But Waterworld turned a decent profit in spite of its problems and mixed reviews, and now it firmly has a fan base willing to love it for the great sci-fi escapism that it is. Now readily available in 3 cuts (Theatrical, TV Edit and Ulysses), you can sample each to find the pros and cons of home format film tampering.\r\n\r\nEven in its theatrical form the film is still a rollicking water based adventure, full of spectacular stunts (oh my those jet-skis rock), amazing sets (whoosh, the sci-fi grandeur of the floating atoll) and blood pumping scenes (the eerie journey and subsequent revelation of a city under water). Sure it's far from flawless as the pace is uneven at times and as plot narratives go it's pretty thin, but Reynolds and Costner have crafted an impressive world submerged by water. The cast, too, are delivering knowing performances. Costner's Mariner is indeed one note, unsympathetic and moody, this guy is a loner and a mutation after all, his sombre persona neatly playing against Hopper's cartoonish, satirical and maniacal villain. Tripplehorn (a porn star name if ever there was one!) beautifully shines in a film populated predominantly by males (there's another flaw for you), Michael Jeter scores favourably as a highly strung elder, while young Majorino is suitably winsome, neatly playing it as a device to mellow the Mariner's cold fishy heart. Take that and fill it out with the detail of the definitive cut (Ulysses) which showcases Reynolds' vision and it's fan nirvana all round.\r\n\r\nIf it was meant to be a serious picture in the first place, a sermon on topical destroying of the Earth, then it fails a touch because the characterisations are bound by cliché manacles. Yet collectively the inhabitants of this Waterworld share a common goal of survival, played out to the backdrop of Reynolds' excellent futuristic setting. When thrust together to make a good versus evil action movie, the characterisations work handsomely within that framework. That is ultimately the best way to enjoy Waterworld, let it wash over you (hrr hrr hrr) in a wave (hrr, OK I'll stop now) of water based action and heroics. It's a world where soil is currency and smoking is a marker for being a bad guy. From the opening shot of the Universal World logo becoming submerged in water, to the bittersweet finale, yes! Waterworld is indeed escapism in its purest cinematic form and becomes a high definition must in the process. 8/10",

              "content": "**Rather poorly edited and cut, this film is downright forgettable.**\r\n\r\nI've seen this movie twice, and I honestly can't believe it. It was truly the same as burning money. After being impressed by the poor quality of the film, I went to read and research about it, and discovered the eventual cause of this disaster: from the beginning, it was a project doomed to failure. Badly planned, it was filmed in a place where the weather conditions would cause problems. The ambition to do more and better is healthy, but in this case it caused an escalation of costs. To make things more difficult, the production was guided by Kevin's disagreement against Kevin, since the director, Kevin Reynolds, was contradicted several times by the main actor, Kevin Costner. The most blatant disagreement may have happened during post-production, with the actor and the studio demanding a straight cut of the film, which was lame and poorly edited. It had everything to go wrong...\r\n\r\nI know, now, that there are extended versions of the film, but I haven't found a \"director's cut\" that would be able to reverse the changes and give us the version that Reynold initially envisioned. What I saw is the “canonical version” of about two hours, and I hated it. The script is based on a very apocalyptic and poorly explained future, where the entire world is flooded, and a myth has been created where, somewhere, there would be land, but which no one has actually been able to confirm. The few surviving people live on atolls and artificial islands, and on boats. The film never shows us a storm, a hurricane or anything that threatens the lives of those survivors, nor does it explain how they survived, or why no one properly explores the world to discover signs of earth. There are a lot of loose ends and absurdities, and the film will only work if we avoid thinking about it too much.\r\n\r\nThe cast rests solidly on Kevin Costner's back, and even those who aren't particularly fans of the actor will have to agree that he makes a good acting exercise, and is charismatic enough to ensure the role that is expected of him, especially if we're considering how indigestible and unsympathetic his character can be. Dennis Hopper is a likable villain, more cartoonish than truly menacing. Jeanne Tripplehorn is decent and satisfying.\r\n\r\nTechnically, the film stands out for its commitment to excellent production values, with the effort and financial expenditure applied being clear: the choice of filming locations is very good, despite having brought many practical and logistical difficulties to the production; the cinematography takes every opportunity to make the film beautiful and elegant. The sets and costumes, made extremely realistically, are excellent, and you can see that they were expensive and detailed. The action scenes were well-thought-out and executed, and could have been better had the film not been structured for such a low rating. Good effects and a soundtrack that satisfies without enchanting make up the overall picture of a rather forgettable film.",

              "content": "Hail to the Science Fiction gods as they came to their senses and granted upon the eagerly movie-going masses the long-awaited arrival of a stunning and opulent _Blade Runner_ sequel. Perhaps we should praise the understated genius and visionary mastermind Ridley Scott for his 1982 directorial accomplishment in serving up what appeared to be an underappreciated and overlooked SF thriller in its heyday over three decades ago only for it to emerge now as one of the greatest Science Fiction futuristic capers worthy of its cult classic following?\r\n\r\nMaybe the long overdue kudos are reserved for the diehard nostalgic _Blade Runner_ bunch whose committed and fanatical fandom was the key catalyst for this undeniably brilliant, brainy, dazzling and polished presentation to resurface and give new vitalizing breath and striking energy to the Science Fiction genre in conception? Could it be possible that Hollywood simply saw opportunistic and healthy box office receipts to restart another pop cultural juggernaut from yesteryear’s cinematic scene?\r\n\r\nIs there a returning Harrison Ford fixation/fetish blossoming courtesy of his past blockbuster film resume that boasts the obvious inclusion of prominent SF/adventure fantasy biggies such as both the _Star Wars_ phenomenon and the _Indiana Jones_ installments with _Blade Runner_ now taking up the matinee mantle?\r\n\r\nRegardless of the film-making forces at hand or the key reasoning for this 164 minute visually arresting odyssey updated and packaged for bombastic _Blade Runner_ enthusiasts and dedicated SF connoisseurs the proof is in the proverbial pudding as **Blade Runner 2049** has made its auspicious presence known and succeeds thrillingly as an indelible wonderment in imagination, intrigue and intelligence.\r\n\r\nBreathtakingly rich and vibrant in its overlong execution, **Blade Runner 2049** is a lustrous escapist epic that resonates with snappy pop, thought-provoking tendencies and atmospheric grittiness that soundly resonates. And yes…the participation of the aforementioned and omnipresent Ford reprising his role from 35 years ago is indeed the appealing and motivating factor to re-enter the anxiety-driven world of intrusive replicants,  societal annihilation and the guessing game of humanity infiltration.\r\n\r\nIt seems that the intense workmanlike charm and structured suspense in the rebooted **Blade Runner 2049** has not missed a single beat as it colorfully brings its brand of contemplative tension and underlying humorous texture to this sumptuous spectacle. Importantly, the film’s philosophical edginess and saturated cynicism stays true to Scott’s unflinching vision of introspection about the valued properties of life and who are the chief architects of such a unique gift of existence. Consequently, speechless Science Fiction audiences once again are transfixed by the mesmerizing yet old adage about the rivaling ‘have’s and ‘have nots’ especially so vital in the gloomy squalor and doomsday darkness that Scott created so fervently in his vintage edition that set the stage for renegade blade runners in a power struggle with defiant, roguish replicants disastrously flirting with the sacred boundaries of humankind.\r\n\r\nFilmmaker Denis Villeneuve (‘Arrival’, ‘Sicario’, ‘Prisoners’) has stepped into some pretty mighty cinematic shoes in dusting of the mothballs of _Blade Runner’s_ haunting and hedonistic past in an accomplished effort to bring forth a percolating potboiler of a challenging and imaginative hue to its succulent successor in 2049 with surging, exquisite aplomb. Screenwriters Michael Green (‘Alien: Covenant’, ‘Logan’) and Hampton Fancher (‘Blade Runner’, ‘The Minus Man’) manage to brilliantly convey the dystopian disillusionment as the caustic yet compelling commentary concerning the decline of humanity and how it is feverishly on the brink of non-existence. The fuzzy lines are crossed for the calculating chaos and corruptible wheels that are turning so aimlessly and shockingly. The sins of sinners, good, bad or indifferent, gloriously are stemmed in moodiness and mystery. Additionally, notably iconic cinematographer Roger Deakins (‘Fargo’) cultivates a dank, hazy-coated landscape where shadowy imagery compliments the dour suspicions of determined man versus durable machine co-existing in a hostile futuristic fantasy world of techno-dismal dimensions. Also, kudos are reserved for Hans Zimmer and Benjamin Wallfisch for their soaring, energetic score that undercuts the tension and turmoil.\r\n\r\nIn a nutshell, Ryan Goslin (Oscar-nominated for 2016’s ‘La La Land’) is a young blade runner known as ‘K’ whose mission is to track down veteran Rick Deckard (the returning Harrison Ford…also a former Oscar nominee) in the aftermath of a major uncovered secretive revelation that requires the missing senior badge-flashing blade runner’s undivided attention. The problem remains, however, is that Deckard has been out of circulation for three decades and so the search is on for K to hunt down the long-absent Deckard.\r\n\r\nIndeed, Officer K’s critical and contemplative police work is, to mildly put it, seek out the about-to-expire, unpredictable and resistant replicants and eradicate them when necessary. The replicants, mechanical menaces with artificial intelligence that are living among the humans incognito, are the main focus of the LAPD and K enthusiastically is immersed in the manhunt for the hidden techno-tyrants with militant mindsets that could strike at any moment among the walking flesh. K strives to put them out of their mechanical misery as his sworn duty to serve and protect but he is handcuffed (no pun intended) by the political politeness and procedural proprieties as pushed by his boss Lt. Joshi (Robin Wright). Basically, K is under surveillance based on his fragile mental state and Joshi is the one to contain this gritty-minded cop’s wandering psyche.\r\n\r\nThankfully, there is undeniable texture and intensity that fortifies **Blade Runner 2049** due to the layered and complex story that effectively taps into the robust realm of man’s possible mercy call at the dominant feet of advanced and sophisticated technology. This observational sentiment certainly rings true in contemporary times as selective human beings feel lost, intimidated, overwhelmed and need to surrender to the mounting shifty pressures of an exposed society seemingly ruled by sinning opportunists on both sides of the shady aisle, mechanisms rendered equally with blood and bolts.\r\n\r\nRefreshingly, **Blade Runner 2049** is devoutly cerebral in passion and old school perception. Oddly, Villeneuve’s mixture of science fictional roots and thought-provoking dramatic art house probing works while adding a realistic and somber milieu of existential foreshadowing. Gosling is gloriously geared as the hound dog-faced law enforcer too close for comfort on the fringe of film noir-style burnout as he gets embroiled deep into an abyss of head-scratching discoveries. Ford does not miss a single beat as the gravel-faced, handsome-aged Deckard saddled in adventurous mode despite the matured years since his early 80s heyday in the mundane, ground-breaking _Blade Runner_ blueprint from yesterday. Oscar winner Jared Leto (‘Dallas Buyers Club’) joyously lets it all hang out as the wickedly off-kilter character Niander Wallace. The feminine inclusion of Wright’s top policing babysitter Joshi and Ana de Armas as K’s love interest, Joi, are welcomed personalities. Ex-wrestler/actor Dave Bautista (hot off the ‘Guardians Of The Galaxy’ film series) is a larger-than-life specimen as always in proven popcorn blockbusters.\r\n\r\nConvincingly well-structured, profound, purposeful and without a prosaic bone in its bountiful body **Blade Runner 2049** is stunningly sumptuous Science Fiction theater for the thinking man and for the progressive machinery master-blasters as well.\r\n\r\n**Blade Runner 2049** (2017)\r\n\r\nWarner Bros.

The first movie was a rather dark one after all and this one is a truly post-apocalyptic one. I quite liked the first movie despite its dark setting though. However this one takes the darkness and melancholy to an entirely new level.\n\nAs I said before, technically the movie is great. The scenery is stunning whether it is a dirty little hut out in the badlands or the equally dirty vast cityscapes. The scenes of the abandoned city where Decker is (re)introduced is sad but beautiful.\n\nThe acting is more or less great from all the main characters and the special effects are very well done and just right to fit with the rest of the movie.\n\nUnfortunately I cannot bring myself to give it more than 3 out of 5 stars. It has nothing to do with the quality of the film but a lot to do with my personal taste which of course is reflected in my ratings.",

Outside of that it's dog dung. The music is a poor knock off Vangelis score. The story is basically fan-service and pandering by the studio with the tons of plot holes. It includes of biblical references, and aspects from the books _Fahrenheit 451_ by Ray Bradbury, that also takes place in 2049, mixed with _1984_ by George Orwell to try to come off as intellectual, but utterly fails and is poorly done. It practically ignored _Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep_ by Phillip K. Dick. The original Blade Runner film did too, but at least that film was interesting. This film doesn't introduce anything new or anything that could be considered an original idea. The editing is awful. Dragging out scenes for no reason other than an attempt to appear \"intelligent and serious\" or to try to mimic 'Blade Runner' doesn't work since there's no reason for it story wise. It's kind of like a Zack Snyder movie, in that regards. The acting is subpar and wooden. Harrison Ford was phoning it in. It's a shallow film that misses the point. Here's a neat idea, why not try to actually adapt _Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep_ into a film.\r\n\r\nI don't understand why people think this shallow movie is an intellectual and intelligent movie.",

But with all that being said, Blade Runner 2049 is a masterpiece regardless of your movie taste. The beauty of the bright neon colors splashing across the cold, dismal, muted city of Los Angeles in 2049 is breathtaking. Every scene and moment is a visual feast filled with practical effects despite being a sci-fi film with flying cars and futuristic technology.

He is \"K\" - working for the new but still all-powerful \"Tyrell Corporation\" tasked with eliminating the last of the \"Nexus\" generation of replicants. It's on one such mission that he, quite literally, unearths a terrible secret that could spell doom for the already crippled society of mankind. \"K\" sets out to gather as much information as he can to prevent this collapse, and gradually comes to realise that the answer might lie with the long disappeared \"Deckard\" (Harrison Ford); his water ego from times gone by. Thing is, though, as his search nears it's conclusion, will he be permitted to discover and act upon the truth? This enhances and augments the original, rather than try to replace it. The story is well held together by a Gosling who makes his presence felt, but who allows the story to develop using imagery and a sparing dialogue. Robin Wright is maybe not the best as his boss \"Joshi\" but it does feature one of the better efforts from Ana de Armas (\"Joi\") as we head towards a denouement that really does look at life as we know it! The photography is dark and gritty, there is a distinct and effective sense of the claustrophobic and the score from Hans Zimmer is one of his best - it really does assist in focussing the attention on the detail of this cleverly constructed and compelling adventure with a conscience.

              "content": "If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog @\r\nhttps://www.msbreviews.com\r\n\r\nKnives Out has been shown in numerous festivals, and it received massive acclaim in literally every single one of them. Therefore, its hype grew more and more until its wide release date. Before the film, I can’t deny that I was indeed affected by the whole “a whodunnit like you haven’t seen in years.” I went into the theater with high expectations, not only due to the festival praise but due to its jaw-dropping cast. It’s uncommon to possess such a renowned ensemble and deliver a “bad” movie, especially when Rian Johnson is writing and directing it (yes, I like The Last Jedi, and even if I didn’t, he did other stuff, you know?). It’s one of those films everyone knows it’s going to be appreciated by a considerable part of the world.\r\n\r\nEven the genre itself is a very welcome type of cinema entertainment in regards to both critics and the general public. So, does it live up to its hype, or it fails to reach such high expectations? Knives Out is one of the best movies of the year, as well as one of the best mystery-suspense stories of the millennium (everyone is doing the whole “best X of the decade,” I’m going one step beyond). This is a film I know I’m going to rewatch countless times throughout the next years. Usually, when it comes to whodunnits, people are misled into thinking that from the moment they know who “did it,” the movie loses its interest. This is rarely true, and Rian Johnson succeeds because he doesn’t need the ultimate reveal to deliver a great story.\r\n\r\nThis screenplay is definitely getting tons of nominations and wins during the awards season. Every little line of dialogue means something. Every single character says or does something impactful to the narrative (except for Jaeden Martell’s). It’s been half-a-day since I’ve seen it, and for every question that my brain comes up with, there’s an answer lying on someone’s words or actions. It’s such an intricate, complex, extremely subtle script. One with so many tiny, little details that it’s impossible to catch them all on a first viewing.\r\n\r\nI genuinely love the first act, even if it’s the one where I have a minor issue. Rian Johnson doesn’t waste time and puts us directly in the crime scene, interviewing each and every member of the family. It’s through these interrogatories that he cleverly introduces the suspects, developing them solely through masterfully written dialogue, and outstanding performances. For example, with a single sentence and a particular body/face expression, Toni Collette instantly creates a profile of Joni, her character. Rian plays with character-types and cliches in such an intelligent manner. He makes us think a particular character follows a specific cliche, then it doesn’t, then it does again…\r\n\r\nThat’s one of the reasons I couldn’t figure out the mystery until the last act reveal. Every time I was close to indeed follow the right path, new developments arise, meant to mislead, confuse, and create doubts. Some people feel better with themselves if they solve the case before the film. They feel “intellectually superior” just because they found out before everyone else. First of all, I prefer being fooled and end up blown away by an unexpected conclusion than solving the whole thing way before time’s up and end up disappointed and bored. Then, honestly, anyone who says, “I guessed it,” there’s a 99% chance that they’re either lying or not answering correctly to the question “who killed Harlan?” If you’ve seen the movie, you’ll understand what I’m trying to express.\r\n\r\n(I don’t want to sound presumptuous or hypocritical. I’m not trying to say, “I couldn’t figure it out, so no one can.” Please, if you haven’t seen the film, judge the previous paragraph after your viewing.)\r\n\r\nThroughout the second and third acts, loose ends start to tie up, ending up with a brilliantly delivered reveal. From the marvelous cinematography (with those classic close-ups when a character is about to say something meaningful or tell a story through their imagination or memory) to the remarkable editing, the team behind Rian Johnson did a phenomenal job. The suspense is held at high levels, and it reaches limit-breaking points with Marta Cabrera’s (Ana de Armas) narrative. Armas and Daniel Craig deliver the standout performances, with Chris Evans (Ransom) following right behind. Literally, everyone else offers excellent displays, and help carry a story filled with mystery, but also with a lot of humor.\r\n\r\nHowever, I have to emphasize how astonishing Ana de Armas and Daniel Craig are. Ana might be a bit unknown to most people. I’ve been supporting her ever since Blade Runner 2049, so I’m ecstatic that she finally got a major role in a big movie, especially within an ensemble of actors with legendary careers. Craig, who could have just delivered a slight variation of the character he’s been playing for years, instead offers a unique take on the Detective role. Just like Evans, both have been playing iconic characters for years, so it’s sort of an extra joke to everyone who watched Captain America and James Bond for the past decade or so.\r\n\r\nMy only minor issue has nothing to do with the political undertone and the social messages Rian Johnson puts in this film. Honestly, I love that aspect of it. It’s like Rian knew some people would complain about it, so he made sure to have a couple of characters (Jaeden Martell’s Jacob and Katherine Langford’s Meg) somewhat resembling the so-called snowflakes and all that. No, my issue is related to some excessive exposition regarding the first act’s interrogatories. It’s great that every character gets their own motivations, but it feels like each confrontation with the detectives went on for a bit too long. Some pieces of the mystery might be a bit hard to believe that they would occur, but these are all nitpicks in a remarkable movie.\r\n\r\nIn the end, Rian Johnson is able to bounce back from the divisive The Last Jedi with one of the best whodunnits I’ve ever seen, Knives Out. Rian proves that not only he’s a talented filmmaker but also a phenomenal screenwriter. With a renowned and impressive ensemble cast, Daniel Craig and Ana de Armas are standouts within all of the other outstanding performances, Chris Evans being right behind. With one of the best screenplays of the year, the mystery at its center keeps everyone extremely captivated until the very end, even if you guess “who did it” beforehand. Masterfully written dialogue, remarkable editing, and great use of classic cinematography techniques. It’s an entertaining story with tremendous replay value and significant political/social layers that only elevate the already complex yet subtle narrative. Don’t miss it!\r\n\r\nRating: A",

A smartly written whodunit movie that manages to be both humorous and classy. The kind of murder mystery that never fails to entertain. Pleasing both cinephiles and mainstream audiences. Perfectly balance, as all things should be. It basically pulls a Hitchcock on us.\r\n\r\nRian Johnson is a great director, but at times has silly ideas. On the other hand, when given the right material I think he’s a great director and writer. He’s also a clever man, but never came off as annoying. The dialogue was so sharply written that I could tell the cast loved every minute of soaking up and delivering these lines. The cinematography was nothing short but beautiful and will often linger in rooms of the house which helps the audience immerse in the overall setting.\r\n\r\nOne of the tightest scripts of the year with raw humor and a satisfying mystery/comedy.\r\n\r\nThe cast is stellar, but the main stand outs for me were Daniel Craig, Ana de Armas, and Chris Evans. I loved Daniel Craig’s Southern drawl which I didn’t expect at first, but I was amazed of how far he went for it. Often times it reminded me of Frank Underwood from ‘House of Cards’. He plays detective Benoit Blanc, AKA CSI: KFC. At one point during the movie he delivers one of the funniest monologues in the entire movie, which was brilliantly delivered by Craig. He should seriously try out more comedy roles.\r\n\r\nDose anyone remember when Ana de Armas starred in Eli Roth’s ‘Knock Knock’? Well look at her now. She was absolutely excellent in this movie. The running joke throughout the entire movie is her character can’t lie and whenever she dose, she vomits on the spot. How ironic, yet I love the comedic irony behind it.\r\n\r\nChris Evans plays a spoiled child with a slimy grin during the worst situations. The over privilege black sheep of the family. This is very against type for Evans, especially when his character hates dogs, which I would imagine being difficult for Evans since he’s a dog lover in real life. Also the different sweaters he wears in every scenes was impeccable.\r\n\r\nThe rest of the cast manage to shine individually in this crowded movie. Although at times some of them felt like background wall paper compared to others. However that never takes away from what else ‘Knives Out’ has to offer.\r\n\r\nToni Collette dose a great impression of Gwyneth Paltrow. Michael Shannon plays a wimpy son to a crime-writer Harlan Thrombey (Christopher Plummer). Despite the small screen time, Plummer is still charming as always. While Jamie Lee Curtis and her character brings the dramatic elements into play. She’s uninterested in the humorous quarrel during the grim situation, as early on she reminds everyone that her father just died.\r\n\r\nJudging it as a whodunit mystery, the pay off itself is slick. The events leading to the death are revealed early into the movie, and instead Johnson remains steps ahead from the audience. There’s an underlining social commentary beneath the foul play. The themes of privilege and underprivileged with the sour taste of bitterness throughout. Nothing deep or new, but at least is trying to say something rather than being one thing.\r\n\r\nOverall rating: My House. My Rules. My Coffee!!!",

              "content": "\"That certainly not what I was expecting.\"\r\n\r\n- Whodunit?\r\n- Rian Johnson.\r\n- Why?\r\n- To subvert the tropes of yet another sub-genre... properly!\r\n\r\nAs divisive as it was, I neither loved nor hated the love-it-or-hate-it The Last Jedi. Maybe because I'm not a huge fan of the much-beloved saga. But I can give you a quick opinion of what I thought about it anyway. The first half almost turned me off completely: tons of lame jokes and out-of-character moments that indicate that Johnson's biggest concern was to subvert expectations and nothing but. The second half of the film was way better. It proved to me that Johnson is actually very capable of adding fresh blood to the saga, so effortlessly to such an extent that I wondered why he struggled so much in the first half.\r\n\r\nIn Knives Out, Johnson didn't add a new spin on the 'whodunit' sub-genre of detective fiction; he took it and turned it on its head. He did so not only by playing with the tropes and mechanisms of this sub-genre -and boy, he did that so exquisitely and gracefully- but he also by using a new and very effective building block: Drama. It doesn't sound new, isn't it? But, actually, relying on it here, in this kind of a story, is nothing short of revolutionary, and that's simply lies in the fact it's unprecedented to build upon it here. The result is nothing but marvellous. And although that, at some point, the main concern of the plot wasn't the murder mystery per se, the mystery didn't lose its sharpness even a tiny bit. And that's a strong proof that everything worked, and integrated, seamlessly. I said integrated because the film has a plethora of comedic bits throughout its runtime -which flies by- and, to be honest, I think every single joke landed perfectly. The film also suggest a political agenda that's exquisitely woven into the plot, and provides a sharp social commentary that's impressively subtle.\r\n\r\nNot only did Rian Johnson reinvigorate this seemingly outmoded and unfruitful sub-genre, but he also did the same thing with a couple of members of the star-studded cast: I didn't know that Chris Evans, Captain America himself, would be better as, well, an \"Anti-Captain America \"; Craig as Blanc is absolutely phenomenal, with his southern accent and caricature detective character; and Jaeden Martell (IT) is very interesting as the weirdo Jacob Thrombey. As for Curtis, Langford, Plummer, Collette and Shannon, Johnson makes an excellent use of their incredible acting abilities, and of their facial expressions and features, especially Shannon with his remarkable menacing countenance. The real standout, though, is Ana de Armas. I mean, she was good in Blade Runner 2049, but here, as she plays my new favourite version of Pinocchio, she proves she's an exceptionally talented actress who is capable of expressing emotions, and changing them readily, only with her eyes. Honestly, I think she should have been nominated for an Oscar!\r\n\r\nOverall, I'm really surprised how much I loved this film. With Johnson superb and clever direction and meticulously-nuanced and witty -albeit slightly too-structured- screenplay, I think this is my favourite - even if it's not my highest-rated - film of 2019. You know what, this film is actually terrible: it's very pretentious; its puzzle is too convoluted for its own good; it has an overabundance of plot twists; it underutilized its stellar ensemble; and it has a lot of plot holes, or -in this case- donut holes! Excuse me, I gotta leave right now!\r\n\r\n(9.5/10)",

I had heard amazing things about this since its release and, man, is the hype befitting. It's a brilliant 131 minutes, even if it feels much shorter than that given how enjoyable it is.\r\n\r\nThe casting is impeccable. Daniel Craig is superb in the role of Blanc, I've actually found Craig a tad hit-and-miss - even with <em>'James Bond'</em> - but he is utterly superb here; even with that unusual yet definitely entertaining accent.\r\n\r\nIt's by no means The Craig Show, though. Ana de Armas is excellent as Marta, she does a lot of heavy lifting in terms of making her character's situation fully believable. She's great from start-to-finish.\r\n\r\nMichael Shannon is top notch too, I literally always find him fun to watch - from <em>'Boardwalk Empire'</em> to, even, <em>'Kangaroo Jack'</em>. Jamie Lee Curtis, Chris Evans, Don Johnson, Toni Collette, Lakeith Stanfield and Christopher Plummer are all fantastic too.\r\n\r\nThe plot is enthralling, it's crafted together expertly. It reveals bits way earlier than I was predicting, which made me worry it was going to all fall flat at any moment but it kept turning out to be the perfect time to twist the story. The comedy is also very funny, I laughed a fair amount.\r\n\r\nA joy to watch! I haven't got a bad word to say about <em>'Knives Out'</em>.",

This is overtly political, and by \"overtly\" I mean that they are screaming through a megaphone, at just about every opportunity, to inject their politics into it.\r\n\r\nOther than that, it is kind of like Clue... if Clue was very careful not to insult some people in their jokes, and very focused in an attempt to insult others with a sheer and unadulterated prejudice. And that kind of makes for a very awkward film where the jokes are so self-aware they can't help but fail.\r\n\r\nSo, basically that is what you are getting, Clue with jokes aimed at the politically correct and a hearty injection of politics. And that is all you are getting.\r\n\r\nBut, hey, if you haven't seen Clue, you might like it. And, if you share the politics and think they should be shrieked in everything, you will totally like it.\r\n\r\nThe rest of us are just going to watch Clue.",

The movie is simply ask who killing old Harlan Thrombey.\r\n\r\nOften these types of films and these types of stories that contain puzzles and crimes are based on old books such as Agatha Christie, Sherlock Holmes, or any other novel, but this story from the movie was written specifically in order to be made in a dramatic form because the story was written for the cinema and the way the story was implemented was far-fetched. Completely different from traditional methods. This is the strong aspect of the film due to its reliance on the theatrical system. It makes you contemplate the music, the method of filming, and the placement of the characters one after the other, as if you are watching a theatrical performance.\r\n\r\nThe most beautiful thing about this theatrical show is the way the characters are presented. Each character sees it for the first time when they are called for investigation by the police and who they are and what is their relationship to the victim. But what is beautiful is when the next character is identified and we know who she/he is and what her/his relationship is to the victim them We start to doubt the stories and information given by the previous character to the investigators\r\n\r\nWith more than one character and with more than one investigation, the contradictions will become clear. This will bring us to the question that comes to our minds after 40 minutes of the movie: Who killed Harlan Thrombey?",

              "content": "**War is like a business zone, anyone can start-up a business.**\r\n\r\nTen years ago a similar film was made with Nicolas Cage in the lead called 'Lord of War'. This was based on the two youngsters who got into arm dealing, but many events were fictionalised. War is a business and these two made lots of profit out of it. So it all begins when financially struggling David clueless about raising his unborn child. At a right time he meets his old friend Efraim and decides to partner with him to supply arms to the US army abroad in a small scale. But when they saw a big opportunity, they decided to give it a try. From the obstacles, they go the extra mile to achieve it. But not knowing how serious the consequences are, finally they step into a dangerous turf and from there, what follows is revealed in the remaining parts.\r\n\r\nThis is really amazing film. Obviously a slow start, but like after 10-15 minutes later it gets better and better. For these actors, this is something big and they have done it excellently. Jonah Hill was simply unbelievable. Kind of good, as well as negative, totally unpredictable character. Mile Teller was superb, he narrated the story with the opening scene, gun pointed at him, the flashback begins. While the story keeps developing, it only gets crazy and crazier. Nearly two long was never been an issue, because of the good pace, as well as for the off beast storyline.\r\n\r\nLately I have been seeing lots of Ana de Armas, quite a coincident to watch some many films of someone in a short time. Anyway, her role in this was small, but she was decent. From the director of 'Hangover' trilogy, I think one of his best films it is. If you like the American Dream themes like 'Pain & Gain' and 'Wolf of Wall Street' about making dollars in a fast way risking everything, you would enjoy it as well. Like those two, it was also a comedy, despite inspired by the real. One of the film posters imitates the 'Scareface', but there's a strong reason for that, so you should watch it. Definitely worth a watch, so I suggest it!\r\n\r\n_8/10_",

              "content": "***Lame-axx butt of a joke no longer*** \r\n\r\nArthur Curry (Jason Momoa) lives with his father on the Maine Coast, a caretaker of a lighthouse. With the mentorship of Vulko (Willem Dafoe) and the revelations of Mera (Amber Heard) he discovers that he is the half-breed heir to the underwater kingdom of Atlantis. As the rightful successor to the throne, he must tangle with his brother Orm (Patrick Wilson) to save the surface world from destruction. Meanwhile Black Manta (Yahya Abdul-Mateen II) seeks vengeance on Arthur for the death of his father.\r\n\r\n“Aquaman” (2018) is a colorful superhero flick featuring a flashy action scene for every 5 minute lull. It’s reminiscent of “Thor” (2011) and “Thor: The Dark World” (2013), but with spectacular undersea realms instead of Asgard & realms nearby. Yet the drama was better in those movies whereas here it feels like the creators were in a rush to jump to the next action sequence, which might make “Aquaman” ‘thrilling,’ but less compelling story-wise.\r\n\r\nStill, it’s very eventful with loads of energy (maybe TOO eventful for its own good). And I liked the balance of underwater scenes to surface scenes with spectacular locations, including the Sahara Desert and Sicily. Meanwhile Amber is stunning as redheaded Mera. Even Nicole Kidman shows up as Arthur’s mother, Atlanna. Speaking of Arthur, Momoa is magnificent as the protagonist and will forever change the public’s generally weak perception of Aquaman.\r\n\r\nThe film is a bit overlong at 2 hour, 23 minutes; and was shot in Australia (Hastings Point, Amity Point, Southport, Main Beach & Currumbin Beach); Newfoundland & Labrador, Canada; and Morocco (Erfoud & Merzouga).\r\n\r\nGRADE: B",

              "content": "I just came back home from watching Aquaman on the IMAX theater in Balexert in Geneva and thought that I should write something up while it’s still fresh in my mind. Something that happens all too rarely.\r\n\r\nI have to say that, overall, I had quite a blast watching this movie. It is indeed a good superhero and special effects extravaganza. In addition it is quite beautiful. A lot of the underwater scenes are very pleasing on the eye indeed. I am quite happy that I managed to drag my ass over to a theater and watch it on a IMAX screen. Some of the hype around it is perhaps a bit too much though. It does not quite reach the masterpiece level after all.\r\n\r\nStorywise, well it is a superhero movie after all so if you expect the story to be profound, logical and watertight you should lay off those mushrooms or whatever you are smoking. That said, the story was not too bad. Pretty straightforward and not too convoluted. A good, solid story suitable for a action/adventure movie.\r\n\r\nI did quite like the main protagonists on the good side. Especially Jason Momoa as Aquaman. I mean his time-to-kick-some-ass-stare was just so…evil. The script writer had put some stupid shit in there where he had to play overly dumb at times but on the whole he was a good guy throughout the entire movie. Almost no whining, angst and anti-hero shit like what have totally ruined most of the Marvel TV-shows lately.\r\n\r\nThe bad guys were not too bad either. Orm was lacking a bit in the bad guy charisma department but Black Manta was oozing despicable bad bad bad asshole from the first scene to the last. I probably should not say this because his weird helmet is indeed true to the comics but, well, it’s weird and kind of looks better in a comics than on the big screen.\r\n\r\nSpecial effects? Well, there is not that much to say really. They are pretty awesome throughout the movie and, as I wrote above, a lot of the time they are also beautiful. The various creatures, underwater vehicles and gadgets are really cool and well designed.\r\n\r\nThe one gripe I have about the movie is the totally unnecessary green preaching crap. Luckily it is confined to a couple of scenes but in those it is really slapped in the audience’s faces. A superhero movie should be entertaining, not preaching. If I want that shit I can turn on the news. It’s a star off from me just for that nonsense.",

It's weirdly kind of... The nicest? Of these movies? Which is not the kind of direction you would think a film in this series would go based on how it started, but Jason Momoa is just charismatic as **Hell**, and _Aquaman_ leans on that a lot.\r\n\r\nBy the time it's over, _Aquaman_ really does hit just about every cliche of the genre there is, which is not exactly high praise. It's certainly not without heart, but it is still more spectacle than substance. But unlike, say, your _Transformers 4_, a movie often levelled the same criticism, it is not trash.\r\n\r\n_Final rating:★★★ - I liked it. Would personally recommend you give it a go._",

              "content": "_Aquaman_ delivers a fun and ambitious adventure for the DCEU, but flounders at its opportunity for true greatness.\r\n\r\nThere is so much to like about _Aquaman_, for starters the action is on another level. The DCEU has really mastered its fight choreography allowing for the directors to get wide, interesting shots of the action without having to add unnecessary cuts. There were so many fight sequences that had me thoroughly impressed with the creativity and the scope of the action. I particularly like how James Wan was able to transition across to the battlefield to show individual fights. It gave them a sense of connectedness that is sorely missing in many superhero films today.\r\n\r\nThe plot of this film had me intrigued, although it does tend to get quite weighed down by how involved the movie is. There are so many kingdoms of Atlantis involved and their relationships can get a tad confusing during the first watch. I was constantly trying to understand the relationships between all of the main members of Atlantis, but luckily, I could grasp the gist of what the story was trying to tell. I really appreciated the fantasy parallels that the directors were going for when it came to Atlantis. It gave it a grand feel on scale to a light version of Game of Thrones. The diversity of the nations was a really nice touch as well, I found it fascinating how each nation evolved independently from each other. The main criticism that I have with the story is the writing. There are so many scenarios or lines of dialogue that were incredibly awkward to watch. I think James Wan was really out of his element writing this movie compared to his cookie cutter horror films that he has built his reputation on. Hopefully he can learn from his mistakes for the sequel.\r\n\r\nI was not overly impressed with the acting in this film either. Jason Mamoa was acceptable as Aquaman but like I said previously there were quite a bit of lines that were delivered awkwardly. I found that the comedic timing of the jokes did not really land and felt out of place in this film. The chemistry between Mamoa and Amber Heard was non-existent, I did not buy for a second that the two were truly in love and the whole build up to the relationship felt incredibly forced. Willem Dafoe was excellent as always and Patrick Wilson was fairly adequate as well. This film had an all-star cast, so it is odd to me that so many lines were delivered awkwardly, I think it is more so on the writing and direction rather than the actors' abilities.\r\n\r\nEven with all my complaints about the film, I still found myself having a good time. Although, I can’t help but wonder, if given a more suitable director and writer, how amazing this film could have truly been.\r\n\r\n**Verdict:** _Decent_\r\n\r\n**Score:** _68%_",

Entire races and armies battle against each other for control of the world's oceans. Beautiful aesthetics fill this movie with stunning Greek landscapes to vast underwater kingdoms to haunting dark caverns. Aquaman is a fun Indiana Jones homage rolled into a comic book origin story anchored by Jason Momoa's tough-guy action hero. One of my favorite comic book characters of all time is Mera, and getting to see her in action was fantastic. Still, some of the changes they made to her backstory were a little disappointing, and her portrayal by a highly polarizing actress seems to have sidelined the character in future films. I loved the excessive action scenes and James Wan's over-the-top climactic undersea war. Everything about this movie felt full throttle, and even though it was a bit much at times, it made for a very entertaining popcorn flick.",

              "content": "    As a child, I remember catching David Lynch’s “Dune” on TV. I was too young to really understand the plot at the time, but I didn’t care, all I knew was that the worms were awesome. When I got a little older, I read the book for my first time. It was the first “adult” book I read on my own, and I was in love with it ever since. I read it many more times growing up, and when the miniseries came out, I watched and recorded it every night, then re-watched it time and time again. When “Children of Dune” aired, I again devoured it happily. In the case of the Lynch film, as I grew, I of course began to see more and more of the flaws, though I personally hold the “Spicediver Edit” in quite high esteem. That particular cut of the film manages to make the Lynch version into what is a genuinely good film, but still imperfect. The miniseries has, up until now, remained my preferred adaptation. Now we have a new adaptation: Denis Villeneuve’s “Dune”, and it certainly is quite different from the previous two versions in many ways, but is it good? Well, at least from my perspective, that answer is complicated. The short version is yes, it is a good film, but it’s not a great one.\r\n\r\n    The gist of the story is straightforward. Many, many millennia in the future, Paul, the son of the Duke Leto Atreides, finds himself and his family caught in plots of intrigue, and betrayal, after taking custody of a new and valuable planet. In order to survive, he finds that he will have to depend on the training of his mother, the Lady Jessica, the help of the planets local population, the fremen, and his growing awareness of a great, yet possibly terrible destiny that waits for him. \r\n\r\n    In reality though, the story is anything but. The novel is infamous for being “unadaptable” with its complex “plots within plots” storyline, along with its sheer size. There is simply too much going on in the story to make it easy to turn into a film, or even a series. The previous efforts have all brought different aspects of the novel to the forefront, and this new version is no different. In broad strokes, it is perhaps the most faithful to the novel in terms of themes, and it certainly emphasizes some aspects of the political commentary behind the novel, such as the missionaria protectiva, which was nowhere to be found in the Lynch film, and only really hinted at in the miniseries. They also spend a little more time focusing on the fremen and their sentiments toward off-worlders after living under the Harkonnen regime, but unfortunately, while it is nice to see these themes in the film, they are undercut by little development. In fact, the entire film suffers on that front. So much of the political context and scheming has been left out that the film as presented feels somehow empty. \r\n\r\n    Early in the film, it is established that the emperor considers the Duke Leto a threat due to his popularity, but never really explores too much beyond it. Even more strangely, the film establishes this, but then later makes it seem like they were never really certain about the fact that the emperor was involved in a key scene, unlike the book, where the Duke was fully aware that they were heading into a trap, and was attempting to outmaneuver his political opponents. The Baron Harkonnen is limited to a few admittedly atmospheric scenes where he more or less confirms the emperor is aiding him in their goal to destroy the Atreides line, but it is reduced to a few scant lines, the bare minimum necessary to understand the plot. This, unfortunately results in very shallow characterization, and the same problem runs throughout the film. Gurney Halleck, Thufir Hawat, and Doctor Yueh are all present, but each of them is only given a small handful of scenes, in which they only speak a few lines each, before they are forgotten to focus on Paul, or beautiful scenic shots. They never feel like fully realized characters in the film, more as brief supporting roles, whom are only present in order to fulfill their roles in the larger storyline. Thufir Hawat receives perhaps the worst treatment in this regard. Even the primary cast are not given a lot of development. We are given enough to know who they are, and a little of their personality, but nothing more. It seems strange, that the longest adaptation of the first half of the novel ever made should have less detail and character than either previous version. It does however, and it certainly hurts the film as a result. Long, moody shots are great, but only when they exist in addition with actual depth. The plot of the film has been streamlined to the point that it feels watered-down, and genuinely wastes the talents of its cast all stuck in roles that have been similarly effected. \r\n\r\n    There are also a few key scenes that actively go against things covered in the book. One scene features the Lady Jessica speaking of secretive matters regarding the bene gesserit sisterhood while sitting in the cockpit of an ornithopter right behind Thufir Hawat, whom would be easily able to hear everything she had just said. Another moment, involves the Reverend Mother Mohiam referring to Jessica as Leto’s “wife”, even though she would know full well that they aren’t married. Yet another moment involves that Shadout Mapes pulling out a crysknife to offer it to Jessica while out in the open, and Jessica is in the presence of guards. The Shadout later sheathes the knife unblooded, and those who have read the book will know why that choice does not work for the film, especially in the context of fremen later being shown cutting themselves before sheathing their knives. Of course, in any adaptation there will be liberties taken, and there are indeed more, but these three moments in particular certainly seem to stand out the most in regards to actively going against aspects of the original novel, and in doing so, hurt this film as an adaptation.\r\n\r\n    With that said, there were things I liked as well. As I have stated a number of times, the film is gorgeous. There are a couple of scenes that certainly seemed to be more “style over substances”, such as a shot of ships rising from the ocean for… no apparent reason, but man do they look beautiful. There is also a very real sense of scale in the film that I can freely admit neither previous version ever accomplished. As a result, there are a few scenes that do far better match their description in the book, and are glorious to watch.\r\n\r\n    I do really appreciate the way they portray the emperor, discussed, but never seen. A powerful force that can be felt looming in the background, his hand guiding everything happening. He is built up excellently, and I will be curious to see how well he is portrayed if we get a sequel. In the previous adaptations, he was prominently displayed and used to provide greater context for the politics of the story, but in the book, he is only ever seen in the end, and keeping book accurate in this case certainly works very well.\r\n\r\n    The film also features the most book accurate version of Paul’s growing prescience, hinting at possible outcomes rather than complete premonitions. The way it is executed is not necessarily without its flaws, or heavy-handedness in a couple of moments, but it works well. Similarly, we also get the story of the bull and Leto’s father for the first time, though the film attempts to make the bull symbolic in a manner I am not sure really works, or is earned.　Also notable is the death of a significant character finally matching their death in the novel. \r\n\r\n    I have also stated that the cast does a great job, and I stand by that. In the entire film, there is not a bad performance in the film. My only complaint would be with the portrayal of the Lady Jessica, who comes across as too emotional, presumably in an attempt to show her ability to shift from being upset to being entirely refined and composed in moments, but that is a matter of writing rather than performance. When it comes to the casting, I personally felt that many of the actors matched their roles well, in particular enjoying the casting of Duke Leto and the Baron. I did not however care much for the gender-swapping of Liet, which served no real purpose, especially when one considers how small the characters role was in this version of the film, though Sharon Duncan-Brewster did a good job with what she had. I also did not care for the casting of Rebecca Ferguson as Jessica. While she is a very good actress, she seemed to me a bit too “girl next door”, rather than the character from the novel that the Duke Leto notes “reintroduced regality into the Atreides line”. \r\n\r\n    When it comes to the score, I will admit that I was not certain how I would feel in regards to Hans Zimmer’s work on the film. The samples I had heard up until this point had been interesting, but I was not sure how it would work in terms of the film itself. I can say that it works well, though there are moments when it feels almost as watered-down as the plot itself. It never really allowed me to feel excited at any point, but it did match the tone of the film very well, and I can easily see myself turning it on whenever I clean my house in order to set a “mood” (Ha! See what I did there?). \r\n\r\n    In conclusion, despite my criticisms, I did enjoy the film. I think it works well enough to be understood, though there may be some moments where the average viewer could find themselves feeling confused. It certainly is a visual spectacle, but one undercut by excessive trimming of detail and world-building. I hope it is successful enough to warrant a sequel in order to finish the story, but I also find that I will not be upset if it does not. As adaptations go, this is no “The Lord of the Rings”. In the end, I have to rate this version of “Dune” closer to the original Lynch film, and maintain the miniseries as my favorite adaptation of an amazing novel.",

              "content": "I'll open by saying I am not a fan of Villeneuve. In fact, I think he's a hack whose only genuine talent is making stupid people falsely think they are actually quite smart. I am also a HUGE Dune fan. They have been my favourite series of books since I first discovered them as a teenager. So although I hoped for the best with this, I was expecting the worst. What I got was somewhere in the middle. It's an OK movie, not great, thankfully not terrible, but OK\r\n\r\nIt got some things right the 1984 Lynch version got wrong, but still somehow managed to get other stuff wrong (including stuff Lynch got right). It was also a surprise how much Villeneuve just lifted directly from the Lynch film, both visually and auditorily.\r\n\r\nThe wardrobe choices were a huge disappointment. If you didn't know the time setting, going just on the clothes in the new Dune you'd be forgiven for thinking it was set a mere forty or fifty years (if that) in the future rather than the twenty thousand years in the future when it's really set. The Lynch stillsuits look futuristic, unworldly, and something that really would keep you alive in the deep desert. The new desert wear looks like they are just going to go dirt biking for an hour or two in our present-day world.\r\n\r\nThe casting (completely ignoring the pointless gender swap) was good, However, with the exception of Paul, Chani, and Rabban the original casting was all better. But the original (apart from the odd decision to use the totally unsuited Kyle MacLachlan) was a masterclass in how to cast the perfect people for the role.\r\n\r\nAnyway, enough of the comparisons, This film is about the first two-thirds of the first novel. I always thought the story would be better told via a big-budget TV series (or even mini-series) rather than a standalone movie. I still think what they tried to cover here was too much for a single movie, but it was a step in the right direction.\r\n\r\nThe film mainly sticks to the book story but does make some needless changes, the most obvious of which being the changes made to both the gender and story of Liet Kynes, which in turn impacts the story of Chani. Most other changes are small and mainly insignificant though.\r\n\r\nThe film being filmed in Norway, Jordan, and Abu Dhabi looks fantastic and very well suited to the large screen. And it's clear a great deal of time, effort, and money was put into the sets that looked equally good as the places they were meant to be.\r\n\r\nThe acting was of a suitably high standard, but unfortunately, many of the Dune names and terms were horribly mispronounced. That and the Hans Zimmer fart that is played constantly throughout the soundtrack is likely to pull people out of their emersion in the movie.\r\n\r\nI was also somewhat surprised by what was left out, OK the source material is VERY dense and obviously some needed to be cut, but I don't really think it's made clear just how crucial melange is to the functioning of the empire and society as a whole. Also what (and why) mentats are is largely ignored, you may think that isn't overly important, but it is at the core of how many things are done in the Dune universe.\r\n\r\nOver all, it's not a bad movie. Despite its flaws, I still think the 1984 Lynch version is better though.",

              "content": "I read Frank Herbert's book, Dune, when I was in high school and really don't remember it much except that it was great and a little scary. At that age, I probably didn't get the subtext message.\r\n\r\nI never saw any movies of it so I decided to watch both the 1984 Dune by David Lynch and the 2021 Denis Villeneuve version sequentially. I'm going to talk about both of them here.\r\n\r\nThis may not be a popular opinion: Lynch's version is **brilliant** and the Villeneuve Dune is absolute **shit**. Here's why:\r\n\r\nFirst, is the Villeneuve Dune slick? Yes, absolutely. I should hope so considering it's nearly 40 years after Lynch did his, for crissake.\r\n\r\nAre the character's in David Lynch's version kitschy and over the top? Yes! That's one reason it's so much better! It's Sci Fi, duh! You watch Marvel movies and suspend disbelief for incredible, imaginary super powers? All of Lynch's characters are downright gritty and believable within this particular surreal fantasy.\r\n\r\nBy the end of the Lynch Dune, I had sympathy for nearly every character in the film. Even the villains caught my emotions. Paul Atreides character development was realistic and attractive.\r\n\r\nVilleneuve's characters? I felt like my neighbor came over and asked, \"Hey, can you come to watch my kid's junior high school play?\" \"Sure, Denis, just let me fill my 1-liter flask with tequila first.\"\r\n\r\nVilleneuve's characters were so damned flat and lifeless that they evoked NO emotional response whatsoever. Although I occasionally sit through a bad flick, I can't remember recently watching a movie as awful character-wise, as the 2021 Dune. If I were an actor on that set, I would be silently screaming. How does a director even do this?\r\n\r\nOh, and where's the creativity? It's 46 years since George Lucas founded Industrial Light & Magic, and Denis can't create one single, new, goddamn space machine 46 years later? (One could argue the hummingbird copter is new, but it's not so creative when you realize that we didn't even know how hummingbird wings actually worked until this millennia.)\r\n\r\nBut here's the real clincher: the screenplay. David Lynch gave us a complete story. Sadly, he didn't have the final cut and disowned his film when the critics panned it. Despite the fact that Lynch is a true artist and genius, the studio took 45 minutes out of the film. 45 minutes! Even ruined by the studio, even 40 years later, Lynch's film has a clear vision and carries the timeless message that Frank Herbert intended. I would LOVE to see the original cut!\r\n\r\nVilleneuve, on the other hand, stopped abruptly in the middle of the book. I now realize that Denis is not about the story. Denis is all about the franchise money, and that sucks. As a result of the bad screenplay, this 2021 version doesn't even carry the socio-political statement it was supposed to have. I want my 155 minutes back.\r\n\r\nI don't watch Part 2s, especially when it comes to void-of-creativity and void-of-character-development Hollywood movies. You can take your bad franchise and shove it up your sci fi black hole.\r\n\r\nAdmittedly, I loved Blade Runner 2049, but this is so disappointing, I may never watch another Villeneuve film again. Do yourself a favor and see David Lynch's version of Dune.",

I can't say this was at all bad and have some mild interest in part two, but, and this says a lot about Villeneuve's great career, this is one of his lesser films. I'll probably at some point give this another watch, especially when/if part two comes out (who knows when that will be). **3.75/5** (rounding it, I was debating 3.5 or 4, went with the latter)\r\n\r\nOn the plus side, it is much better than the 1984 adaptation.",

              "content": "I was really eager to watch this movie and at the same time a wee bit concerned because I knew that I would be hugely disappointed if it turned out to be another movie massacring a classic source material.\r\n\r\nI have to admit that it was a very long time since I read the Dune books but I have to say that the movie was mostly true to the books, as I remember them, and also reasonably free of agenda driven rubbish apart from the odd replacement of some characters with “gender correct” ones for no real good reason.\r\n\r\nThere is really not much point in me saying much about the story. It should be well known for any science fiction fan and it is a great story and really good material for a big screen movie despite some “critics” at Rotten Tomatoes moaning about it and calling it unwieldly etc. Probably too big a book with too many words for the small, agenda driven, brains of Rotten Tomatoes “critics”. No surprise there.\r\n\r\nThe movie as a whole is wonderful to watch, the scenery is oftentimes very beautiful and the décor, the buildings, the machinery is very well done. I was surprised that the world of Caladan was portrayed as a rather austere Scottish looking landscape but after getting over the initial surprise it worked very well actually.\r\n\r\nI also like that the Harkonnen, especially the Baron, are not turned into some exaggerated comical figures but, although disgusting and despicable, they are actual humans.\r\n\r\nOverall the casting was quite good and everyone played their roles well. At the beginning I felt that Paul was a bit too wimpy, from what I remember of the book he was quite well trained and skilled already from the start, but he picked up as the movie went along.\r\n\r\nIt is a science fiction, borderline fantasy, movie so there should be some special effects, right? This is a difficult movie to make special effects for since this universe is a weird mix between futuristic science fiction, fantasy elements and old-fashioned traditions.\r\n\r\nI have to say that they succeeded quite well though. The atmosphere felt just right, ships, spice harvesters, buildings looked cool and fitting the story. The way they implemented the personal shields was very nice. They didn’t go overboard on special effects and weird designs. The ornithopter was of course totally ridiculous from a scientific point of view but at least it looked pretty cool.\r\n\r\nIf I should complain about something, although that is not the fault of the movie but of the source material, I have never understood how, in a universe which is obviously driven by hidden agendas, machinations and assassinations, the Atreides could just pick up everything, leave their home and put all their important eggs in one basket at Arrakis.\r\n\r\nOne more small thing that I could complain about would of course be that we now have to wait two years, from what I have read, until we get to watch the next movie to get to the part were the really cool stuff happens.\r\n\r\nBottom line, this was movie is definitely in there vying for the title “best movie that I have watched this year”.",

              "content": "_Dune_ was a massive undertaking due to the sheer amount of lore and political backstory director Villeneuve had to fit in a two-and-a-half-hour run-time, but I am happy to say it was executed brilliantly.\r\n\r\nThe story of _Dune_ is incredibly deep, there are so many layers of political factions and relationships that it can get quite confusing at times. I had to constantly be looking up specific individuals and their ties to each other to understand the minor nuances of the story. Despite that fact, Villeneuve is still able to deliver a coherent narrative that will allow the majority of the audience to understand the overarching plot. After the buildup of the first act, the story gets cooking, and I was utterly invested.\r\n\r\nThere is an incredible atmosphere present in this film. It begins as a Sci-Fi epic, following a house starting anew on a fresh planet and a new industry to conquer. You can feel the optimism and the sense of discovery in the shots due to the interesting angles, lighting, and a brilliant soundtrack composed by Hans Zimmer. But as the narrative evolves so does the tone, as a thick fog of helplessness bleeds on to the screen and you can feel the dread form. This tone was quite refreshing in today’s blockbuster cinema, as each movie needs to incorporate a vast amount of unnecessary comedy to appeal to the broader audience. Dune is unapologetic about what the story is trying to deliver and gives you exactly what it wants without any concessions.\r\n\r\nThe visuals are stunning throughout the entire runtime. One of my favorite scenes was during the spice extraction visit. I loved the blend of realism that was used in this Science Fiction setting. The ships and equipment look like they could exist in our own world with a few technological advancements. The fight choreography is really well done, especially the hand-to-hand combat. The final scene was epic, each fist and punch were so sharp and calculated, it was really impressive to watch in the age of jump cut action.\r\n\r\nThe acting is perfect throughout the film, I really cannot point to any one character that felt off or out of place. Timothee Chalamet did an incredible job as the lead man. He delivered a heartfelt performance and evolved throughout the entire film into the confident leader the story crashendos on. Rebecca Ferguson, Oscar Isaac, and Josh Brolin all did great jobs as well. I really brought the somewhat complex nature of Lady Jessic and Duke Leto, they had really great chemistry with themselves and with their son. Stellan Skarsgard had my favorite performance of the entire film. I felt entirely disgusted everytime he was on the screen, and he made the hairs on the back of my neck stand tall. He is truly a man poisoned by greed and will not stop at anything on his path to fortune. Jason Momoa does a fantastic job here too. I felt he really fit his role and his lines were delivered effortlessly, much better than his performance in the DCEU.\r\n\r\n_Dune_ delivers a fantastic Sci-Fi epic that gave me everything I was looking for and I will be eagerly awaiting the sequel's release.\r\n\r\n**Score:** _88%_\r\n\r\n**Verdict:** _Excellent_",

The cast was top-notch, and the scale that Denis Villeneuve evoked in every scene was breathtaking.

              "content": "My thoughts on the latest Dune movie are a bit mixed. I walked into the theater without much knowledge of the story, which left me a bit confused at the start. However, as the movie progressed, it felt like a mix of Star Wars and Tremors, which was intriguing.\r\n\r\nTimothée Chalamet is one of my top three favorite actors, and he didn't disappoint in this film. Alongside him, Rebecca Ferguson delivered a stellar performance, portraying a queen-like character with grace. The movie boasted an impressive cast from various backgrounds, adding depth to the story.\r\n\r\nVisually, the film was stunning, with planes resembling dragonflies and captivating scenes. Yet, I found it challenging to follow the plot entirely, leaving me with many unanswered questions. While enjoyable to watch, it lacked a clear setup for a potential sequel, which was a bit disappointing.\r\n\r\nZendaya's role, heavily promoted, turned out to be minimal, which may disappoint fans. On the other hand, seeing Jason Momoa and Dave Bautista in different roles was refreshing, showcasing their versatility as actors. The portrayal of Chalamet as a Jesus-like figure felt a bit forced but didn't overshadow the overall experience.\r\n\r\nDespite its flaws, I believe Dune has the potential to evolve into a successful franchise if given the chance. While it may not have matched the wow factor of some other first films in franchises, it's worth a watch for its cinematic experience. I'd rate it a six out of ten, with Chalamet and Ferguson stealing the show with their stellar performances.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, Dune is a movie worth watching, especially on the big screen. It has the elements to become a long-lasting franchise, but its success ultimately depends on audience reception. Give it a chance and see for yourself the potential this film holds.",

Well not for long! \"Black Manta\" (Yahya Abdul-Mateen II) is still a tad narked after the last film (five years ago!) and now armed with an useful geek \"Dr. Shin\" (Randall Park) sets out to discover a secret trident that will enable him to destroy \"Atlantis\" altogether and maybe also release the long captive \"Kordax\" (wasn't that the stuff they used to make telephone cables from?) to help make his revenge complete. Initially hopelessly outgunned by his nemesis's sonic gun, he has to resort to the drastic step of rescuing his imprisoned brother \"Orm\" (Patrick Wilson) - whom you may recall he was instrumental in deposing and incarcerating in the first place; and hoping that he will join forces with them, \"Atlanna\" (Nicole Kidman) and \"King Nereus\" (an almost unrecognisable Dolph Lundgren). With battles lines drawn the films goes from \"Narnia\" to \"Middle Earth\" via the \"Lost World\" and even a bit of \"Ice Station Zebra\" for a series of ploddingly slow and disappointing set-piece adventures. To be fair, the last half hour does lift the pace a little, but by then I'm not sure if it wasn't all just a rather too late. Momoa is trying very hard here, but he's no Dwayne Johnson, and even the dulcets of John Rhys-Davies as the \"Brine King\" - with or without his claw - can't really raise this from it's pretty weak and feeble doldrums. Of course it looks good, loads of quality CGI and visual effects, but the story is light and overly strung out for two hours that really did feel more like two days at times. It's harmless fodder for Christmas cinema with very little to actually dislike about it - it's just the latest in a series of equally forgettable super-hero films that I suspect will leave no impact at all in the snow afterwards.",

That is until now, because <em>'Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom'</em> isn't any good. I admittedly only mildly enjoyed the original - I had to watch a recap because I had forgotten basically everything about it since viewing it in May 2021.\r\n\r\nThe cast are hit-and-miss. I have no negatives for Jason Momoa, he is more than satisfactory from start to end. I did find his eyes distracting (wait, not like that) with the effects used, I don't remember them being so in-your-face (pardon the pun) in the 2018 film - but I could be totally misremembering, to be fair. Either way, Momoa is the obvious star.\r\n\r\nYahya Abdul-Mateen II's character is one I can barely remember, but the actor himself is good - I am a fan. The rest of those onscreen are fine acting-wise, but I really wasn't invested in any of them whatsoever; from Patrick Wilson (especially) to Amber Heard to Dolph Lundgren to Nicole Kidman. I think it's their character designs that I find most uninteresting.\r\n\r\nI am kinda looking forward to seeing what James Gunn and Peter Safran produce with the DC Universe come 2025, on paper with those two in charge it should be a success - just depends how much so, I guess.",

The best movie to grab yourself a large bag of popcorn, put your brain on stand-by and enjoy a fun ride.\r\n\r\nThe story, admittedly, was nothing special. It was enough there to make you follow the plot, but other than that - there wasn't much there. Could it have been better? Yes. Does that kill the movie? No.\r\n\r\nThis movie is more like a guilty pleasure for me and I would watch it because of the world of Aquaman and all of its details. This is were the movie really shines. The production design is 10/10 for me. And the action is good, too.\r\n\r\nSo, if you want a deep and very good story, you might be disappointed.\r\n\r\nBut if you are somebody to enjoy a fun and very well made \"Superhero Aquaman theme park ride\", a classical \"grab yourself a bag of popcorn and turn your brain off\" movie - this one may be for you.",

It explores the themes of loss, grief, and growing up in a captivating way that resonates with anyone who has faced challenges in life. It balances the drama with moments of humor, especially in the interactions between the young boy and his father, who have a realistic and touching bond. The ending was satisfying and emotional. The movie also excels in its visual aspects, with stunning cinematography, art direction, and setting that create a vivid atmosphere of the Sicilian culture and lifestyle of the time period in which the movie is set. The casting was spot on, with the young actor and Monica Bellucci delivering outstanding performances. Bellucci in particular impressed me with her expressive eyes in the market scene, where she conveyed the character’s feelings without words. As a man, I related a lot to Giuseppe Sulfaro character and his coming of age. Honestly, I didn't think I was going to like this movie as much I did when it finished. Rarely do I ever bother writing reviews for a movie I liked but this one I loved. Definitely worth a watch.",

              "content": "<a href=\"http://www.cutprintfilm.com/reviews/spectre/\"</a>\r\n\r\nIn hindsight my excitement for Spectre seems a bit foolish. After Skyfall, director Sam Mendes openly stated that he wouldn’t direct another Bond movie. And even so, Skyfall wasn’t the best of the new Bond films by any measure – dragging on for much too long. But somehow I got sucked into the hype of Mendes’ vision for an homage to the classic Bond, with that somewhat iconic poster of Craig mimicking Roger Moore, and trailers the emphasized a kind of retro re-visitation of some old villains and themes. But Spectre is none of those things, instead it is a film where everyone involved feels like they are just going through the motions. Spectre tries very hard to be an homage to the vintage James Bond classics, but instead ends up feeling more like a mockery of the series.\r\n\r\nFor starters the script is outrageously weak and predictable. Bond goes from shootout, to chase, to sex scene, saying and doing the exact same things he has done for the last 23 movies. Instead of a complete story, the film is just a collection of set pieces and scenes loosely stitched together. And while some of them work well on their own, by the second or third fight scene, you won’t be able to stop yourself from yawning. When you aren’t yawning you’ll be laughing, and not in a good way. The dialogue is downright cheesy. Gone is all of Bond’s smooth charm and ability to sting his opponent’s with his tongue just as much as with his gun. Instead at one point, he throws a watch bomb and says: “Time flies!”\r\n\r\nBond is one a secret mission, assigned to him by M (Judi Dench) via a video message delivered after her death. The film doesn’t ever attempt to invest the audience in this mission, or in Bond’s motivation for seeking out Oberhauser (Christoph Waltz) – which apparently has something to do with his foster-father and his childhood, again – but it never seems important to the story or to James. Meanwhile, a new joint secretary, Max or C as he is known (Andrew Scott), is attempting to unite the world’s intelligence under one surveillance network – and through doing so making the Double-0 program obsolete. Lucky for him, Sam Mendes is already doing that for him.\r\n\r\nHowever, Spectre is a beautiful film. There are about five or six huge set pieces, all of which are wonderfully filmed. And if you are just in the mood the veg out and watch Bond cruise through the streets of Rome in a prototype Aston Martin, than this is the movie for you. But things go on for entirely too long, which would be fine if something of interest were happening. But almost nothing does. Bond gets in a situation and gets out, all while throwing a few pithy, laughable, lines out.\r\n\r\nDaniel Craig has never been more disconnected from the character James Bond, than he is in Spectre. I must say first, that I love Craig as an actor and as James Bond – he is my favorite of all the Bonds. But here, he is uncharacteristically not James Bond. A scene for instance where bond throws his gun into the river, is done in such a fancy foppish way that I cringed. It is tough to properly convey how Craig misses the mark in Spectre, but when you see it, you won’t be able to help feeling the same way.\r\n\r\nMaybe Sam Mendes and screenwriter John Logan did succeed at creating a perfect homage to the Roger Moore era Bond films? Because in reality, none of those films standout as great movies. From start to finish, Spectre feels like someone filling out a madlibs of Bond scenes, and praying that when they read it back, it makes some sense.",

              "content": "Well, cinema’s most treasured and resilient British spy guy is back as the legendary James Bond makes his twenty-fourth outing on the big screen in the highly anticipated and slickly-made Spectre. Worldwide Agent 007 fans understandably maintain their embedded expectations and vision as to what calculating and cunning mission their suave and sophisticated gun-toting, martini-sipping espionage thrill-seeker will encounter in his latest globe-trotting episode. Whatever Bond enthusiasts have in mind for the future twenty-fifth entry of the “licensed to kill” Lothario they should simply settle for the present stimulating currents that trickle as mind-bending material in the polished and percolating Spectre.\r\n\r\nAs for the dynamic performer that have served his time with action-oriented cinematic sensibilities through three previous super-charged James Bond installments, the steely-jawed and diligent Daniel Craig is back on the saddle again for his fourth stint as the crafty 007. Naturally both ardent and casual Bond followers can rattle off the filmography of Craig’s on-screen tour of duty as the debonair and daring secret service operative and even rate the previous films as they compare and contrast each edition.  Some may give special attention to Craig’s first foray into stepping inside Bond’s explosive shoes for 2006’s Casino Royale that is considered a spectacular introduction for the dramatically trained actor. In 2008’s Quantum of Solace, it was a mixed bag at best as Bond followers for the most part gave this second 007 rendition an ambivalent sign of approval (not too many were thrilled with the awkward movie title either). Thankfully, 2012’s Skyfall bounced back for Craig’s take on the roguish Bond and made for some exceptional brownie points as the cagey spy returning to creative prominence. Now 2015’s Spectre hopes to make some hearty tie-ins to Craig’s past big screen adventures as the stoic jet-setting dynamo ridding the world of masterful riff raff.\r\n\r\nIn actuality, Spectre is serviceable in that it is an elaborate and excitable reminder of the preceding Bond films where bits of nostalgic elements from yesteryear are sprinkled throughout its presentation. Sure, some wily 007 fanatics may spot a few of the tossed in nods to the aforementioned Casino Royale and Quantum of Solace in particular as the proceedings unfold. For the most part, Spectre acts as a mere bridge to the launching of the upcoming 25th Bond actioner in waiting. To be fair the other Bond films have served as a welcome mat to the next chapter of the late Ian Fleming’s engaging and charismatic man of action so why should not Spectre be any different in this regard? Still, this spy caper has its signature swagger that Bond aficionados relish with familiarity: heart-pumping action sequences, exquisite locales, desirable and devious Bond women, majestic car chases, larger-than-life villains and their loyal henchmen, imaginative gadgets and inventive technology and yes…the indomitable James Bond at your service. Nevertheless. the minor knock on Spectre is that it could have risen to the occasion more than it did as it occasionally feels as if it is going through the mischievous motions. It never resorts to the levels of Bond-ish drudgery in Quantum of Solace so that certainly is a relief in that aspect.\r\n\r\nSpectre does incorporate its share of opulence, mystery, suspense, shadowy tension and perilous plight. However, where the standard Bond film-making characteristics are somewhat consistent and captivating (i.e. the breathtaking opening sequence of the Day of the Dead celebration in Mexico City) there is also a questionable consideration for the weak-kneed Bond theme song in Sam Smith’s “Writing’s on the Wall” which seems so inadequately suited for a James Bond signature tune. Even the indifferent observers of the James Bond film franchise for the last five decades can attest to the two most important stamps of a Bond film–its opening scene and surging theme song.  Thankfully, Spectre’s grand opening sequence obeys traditional Bond practices but Smith’s doggedly tired-sounding “Writing’s on the Wall” feels as it belongs attached to an old televised After School special from the mid-70s. Wouldn’t you give your kingdom for Paul McCartney and Wings’ “Live and Let Die” or Carly Simon’s “Nobody Does It Better” or perhaps even Sheena Easton’s “For Your Eyes Only”?\r\n\r\nOne thing that can be said about Craig’s Bond in Spectre and that is his image transformation has been elevated to that of a fashion plate whose GQ stylized look has taken quite a step up. Not since Roger Moore’s Bond has there been a clear case of dazzling attire on display for Agent 007 to strut his stuff in spiffy clothing accessories throughout his ventured travels. Craig, billed as a “blue-collar” Bond whose demeanor is more blunt and workman-like, takes comfort in basking in the finesse shadows of a classic Agent 007 almost foreign to his distinctive spin on the iconic spy. In fact, the overall vibe for Spectre seems to lie in the middle of old school and new school James Bond mythology where the shading suits both camps of the ever-lasting film franchise.\r\n\r\nDirector Sam Mendes, who handled the direction for the previous Skyfall, finds the right tone and temple for Spectre that certainly shows off its lavish and ambitious production values as the set designs, scenic locations, fabulous pre-credits action sequence are all indescribable in majestic scope. No one can accuse Spectre as to not holding its own in visual functionality. Wisely, Mendes does not forget his Skyfall background players as they reunite with Craig’s Bond and partake in the sensationalized cat-and-mouse caper. It is refreshing to see Ralph Fiennes back as “M” not to mention Ben Wishaw’s “Q” front and center. And a Craig-fronted Bond film would not be the same without Naomie Harris as Miss Moneypenny.\r\n\r\nAgent 007 fans will find a common \"Bond\" with Daniel Craig and his fourth outing as the licensed to kill Lothario in the stunning and kinettic SPECTRE\r\nAgent 007 fans will find a common “Bond” with Daniel Craig and his fourth outing as the licensed to kill Lothario in the stunning and kinetic SPECTRE\r\nIt is a given that the diabolical criminal network known as SPECTRE has always had its affiliation with the Bond universe especially in the classic Sean Connery Bond-age years. Instinctively, SPECTRE’s evil heart and soul was pumped continuously by that organization’s dastardly mastermind Ernst Stavro Blofeld. Oscar winner Christoph Waltz does the sordid honors of taking the reins as Bond’s nemesis Franz Oberhauser in Spectre with devilish delight and is more colorfully corrupt thanks to his handy go-to muscular minion Mr. Hinx (ex-professional WWE wrestler and “Guardians of the Galaxy” star Dave Bautista) echoing the memories of beloved brute Jaws (played by the late Richard Kiel) from The Spy Who Loved Me and Moonraker). \r\n\r\nWe can never forget that along with Agent 007 folklore comes the responsibility of being labeled a treasured Bond babe. And although the latest sultry women represented in Spectre will never make us forget the iconic likes of Dr. No’s Ursula Andress (Honey Ryder) or Casino Royale’s Eva Green (Vesper Lynd) for that matter they still hold their own and give a measure of titillation to both Bond and the vast amount of male admirers wishing they carried a gun and wore expensive tuxedos while being at the receiving end of a provocative smooch by these vibrant vixens. Lea Seydoux’s Madelene Swann and Italian siren Monica Bellucci’s Lucia are on board as the Bond bombshells for hire.\r\n\r\nAs a whole, Spectre has its up and down moments and never is quite sure about standing alone as an independent Bond story or being dismissed as a pit stop for 007-related flashbacks and reference bits ode to yesteryear’s glory of the super spy’s engaging and raging exploits. The verdict is that Spectre ultimately satisfies one’s craving for the invincible James Bond whether you can to relive his vintage reputation or look forward to a millennium-enhanced production that will grow with the ageless wonderment pertaining to Fleming’s literary ladies man-turned movie-making mainstay of action-packed cinema for half a century. As one-time Bond songbird Carly Simon would attest in her soothing lyrics, “nobody does it better…”  Yet in the dimensional escapist world of James Bond this particular go-around could have been a tad bit better.\r\n\r\nSpectre (2015)\r\n\r\nSony Pictures\r\n\r\n2 hrs 28 mins.\r\n\r\nStarring: Daniel Craig, Christoph Waltz, Lea Seydoux, Naomie Harris, Ben Whishaw, Dave Bautista, Monica Bellucci, Andrew Scott\r\n\r\nDirected by: Sam Mendes\r\n\r\nMPAA Rating: PG-13\r\n\r\nGenre: Spy-Espionage Caper/Action & Adventure/Suspense Thriller\r\n\r\nCritic’s rating: ** 1/2 stars (out of 4 stars)\r\n\r\n(c) Frank Ochieng (2015)",

              "content": "> Not your usual Bond movie, but still a good entertainer.\r\n\r\nWhat I liked from a couple of last Bond movies was they were off the regular 007 style, like not overly rely on spy's special gadgets. This change has been since the day one of Daniel Craig as a famous British spy, James Bond. Anyway, he's the most fittest (muscular) Bond I've ever seen and he's celebrating 10 year anniversary with this film release. But the question is whether he to do another film or done with the franchise. The doubt after the confusing end of this film.\r\n\r\nThe end was quite clear on the story perspective, so I kind of felt it was a farewell for Craig. But, later I came to know that the official source says Bond25 will be his fifth and so on till he opts out himself. 'Spectre' was a very simple Bond movie I have ever seen, but I can say the production quality was so good that you can't resist the enjoyment. The actors, they were also good, but not as I anticipated. Maybe many scenes were very ordinary for a Bond movie, that's comparable with the nowadays action movies, otherwise it was not as bad as critics expressing their disappointment.\r\n\r\nYou can't believe what I was disappointed, you know when they say what the C stands for - is that the best word they come up with against the M for Moron? Anyway, James Bond movies have always had ups and downs, the last film 'Skyfall' was a mega hit and now this has not stood up to that standard. But very entertaining with all the actions and unexpected turns in the narration. As a spy movie, it was okay, but as a Bond movie is what might upset you, so its upto you how you look at it. But to be honest, I enjoyed it.\r\n\r\n7/10",

Needless to say, \"007\" (Daniel Craig) has his doubts about this and after a manhunt to Rome (via Mexico) that must have cost billions, he alights on an exclusive gathering of the criminal great and good working for the eponymous organisation. Along the way, he manages to enlist \"Q\" (Ben Whishaw) and \"Moneypenny\" (Naomie Harris) in his quest to find the daughter of his old nemesis \"Mr White\". She - \"Madeleine\" (Léo Seydoux) may well know how to help him thwart the ambitions of this secretive and deadly organisation before it is all too late. There are plenty of (extended) action scenes here and the gadgets work well enough, but the story is thin and the characterisations lacking. The dynamic lacks jeopardy - we know who is likely to be behind the cunning plots right from the start and neither Fiennes nor Scott bring much to the party. Indeed the latter is really rather poor. What menace there is, is delivered via some underwhelming contributions from Dave Bautista's \"Hinx\" and from the appearances of Christoph Waltz, but they are all too infrequent to bolster the storyline before an ending that was, frankly, ridiculous - even by \"Quantum of Solace\" (2008) standards. The producers seem to be constantly trying to reinvent \"Bond\" without realising that the more they compromise the standards of the story and weaken the traditional characters, the less impact the franchise has when surrounded by many others of this genre that benefit from stronger writing and a more charismatic star. This is shorter than many of Daniel Craig's other outings as Ian Fleming's master spy, for which I was grateful because this is all rather mediocre from start to finish.",

Unfortunately, these expectations climbed too high for Spectre to meet. While the story did a decent job of trying to tie all the Craig Bond films together and introduce a new supreme criminal mastermind, it didn't fully satisfy or carry the weight it intended. There were some exceptional action sequences, with the opening scene in Mexico City as one of the most stunning and impressive of the franchise. The train fight with Dave Bautista was incredibly entertaining as well, but much of the action felt restrained like Craig was tired of the role and didn't want to push the boundaries on some stunts. Seydoux and Bellucci each brought something new with their Bond Girl portrayals providing emotional exploration and depth unusual for a Bond film. Spectre is a great spy movie and a fun Bond flick, but unfortunately, it didn't live up to the level of hype and expectation set before it. After Casino Royale and Skyfall delivered so much more than a typical Bond film, Spectre seemed to settle for the status quo (which is still good but had all the pieces it needed to be incredible.)",

The dialog is clumsy.\r\nThis is to be expected from the changes around 1970, when the writer's guild became immensely jealous of talent and good writing, and only produced the writers with zero talent.\r\nAnd now those writers are the \"judges\" of new writers, God help this culture.\r\nThe change in format should have changed long ago, about 1995, into \"sons and daughters of 007\", with 007 as a background figure, say fifth or sixth billing, with his sons and daughters taking center stage in this \"less action, more computer\" world.\r\nA lot of us said this well before 1995. It was painfully obvious, but we live in a world where Hollywood went total hack in the seventies, with those hacks endorsing the worst hacks of today.\r\n\"Spectre\" kind of gives us an introspective look at this with the timeline element. Bond faces the usual super enemy power, and fights the establishment which brings in the computer age.\r\nThe character of 007 is the only thing that is salvaged in these new movies. It isn't Daniel Craig's fault that he is 007 for the worst writers, writers who are into the neo Nazi ideology of the seventies where women must be blond and pale, and any man who tries to save a brunette is doomed, but save a blond, and you're a success. The Hitler worship is so extreme in the modern Bond movie writing that it's impossible to deny it is there. \r\nAnd the directors are pathetic. Even given the ideal exotic locales, they manage to dumb down the scenery. One feels like the director actually says \"How can we make this beautiful and exotic scenery look dull and depressing? Aha! I can do it!\"\r\nOf course the day will come when Craig will be the beneficiary of this fame and get to do actually good films for which he'll be remembered. \r\nThis movie is pretty much formula. The action is okay enough, and it isn't as contrived to be depressing as Casino Royale or A View to a Kill, but it is depressing and dull.",

              "content": "I would say that this movie is pretty much the kind of movie that I expected it to be. That being said I think it was a bit softer than I hoped it to be. I think that, again, the Hollywood plonkers have opted to make a movie that got a more palate rating (to them and their cash registers) than what it should have been. It is not as obvious as with Robocop and a few other movies but the feeling is there.\r\n\r\nIt is still a fairly entertaining movie. It is of course yet another special effects movie and as such it does not disappoint. It differs from a lot of the usual special effects movies in that the effects are pretty down to Earth in a bizarre way. We are not talking about superheroes or near magical technologies here but instead we have a devastated landscape, scrounged together equipment and a totally ludicrous desire to blow up the last remains of human civilisation. The bizarre vehicle designs and the totally ridicules behaviour of a lot of people in this movie is alone worth watching it to be honest.\r\n\r\nAs with the previous Mad Max movies this one stretches the bounds of reality (I hope) when it comes to human behaviour and how they waste the few precious resources, specifically gasoline and bullets, that remains after the apocalypse. It provides some spectacular scenery but it also puts a bit of “what the f…” feeling to it all. Not that this part is not expected from a Mad Max movie though.\r\n\r\nWhat I think was my largest let-down in the movie was the Mad Max character itself. To me he is supposed to be a real bad-ass. In this movie he was not really that impressive. He certainly was far from the original Mad Max character in my opinion and was really overshadowed by the Furiosa character. I could have lived with that if this character would have been really impressive but she was not. She was cool but she was still underwhelming when comparing to anything in the original bad-ass Mad Max universe. I would say that Tina Turner and Mel Gibson still rules!\r\n\r\nStill it is a decent futuristic, apocalyptic action movie, maybe not living up to this old movie geeks expectations, but not at all a wasted movie evening. The sound track of the Blu-ray certainly gave my subwoofer an exercise as well.",

Some time later on though, I will post a spoiler talk that goes into greater depth. For now though, enjoy this spoiler free review of _Mad Max: Fury Road_!\r\n\r\nThe number one complaint I’ve been seeing about _Fury Road_ is that there’s not much of a story. I would respond by saying, there might not be as much story as you could **want**, but there is certainly as much as you could **need**. The plot isn’t deep, or complex, or intricate, or philosophical. but it’s there, and it makes sense. Just last year, _John Wick_ showed us that you can get away with a pretty thin premise, if you work hard enough on building a thick, palpable world. And the world of _Fury Road_ is something else entirely, I can see why people aren’t blown away by the story, but the world is incredible.\r\n\r\nThere has been much discussion as to whether Max himself, or his cohort Furiosa (played by Charlize Theron) is the star of the film. I would argue that neither of them are. Director George Miller is. This is his vision. Warner Brothers took a big risk when they handed a 70 year old man nearly two hundred million dollars to revitalise his franchise which has been dead for 30 years, then get out of the way and let him do his thing. But it paid off. _Fury Road_ is more of an “experience” than most movies are, it just happens to be a great film, too.\r\n\r\nThe stunt work and visual effects deserve praise all to themselves. According to the filmmakers, roughly ten percent of all the effects were done with CGI. The other NINETY are practical, and it oozes with that spectacle. You really can feel the maximum force of the future sitting in that theatre, which is a rare and unexpected pleasure.\r\n\r\nIt’s my highest rated film of 2015 thus far, in fact, it’s one of only five films I’ve given more than 4 stars in the past five years. So please don’t take the recommendation lightly when I ask you all to go out and support this movie. Just make sure you do it in the biggest, best quality cinema you can, because this latest entry to the _Mad Max_ franchise is worth it.\r\n\r\n91%\r\n\r\n-_Gimly_",

              "content": "When I saw the reviews for this movie my first thought was \"Every critic has lost their minds... even me.\"\r\n\r\nThe story is about a post-apocalyptic wasteland - the fight for survival has twisted the remnants of mankind, turning most into mad, vicious gangs. In this chaotic world two rebels may be able to restore order while seeking their own forms of redemption: Max, a man who just wants peace after losing his wife and child and Furiosa - who thinks finding her childhood home is the answer.\r\n\r\nWhat a lovely day to be talking about Mad Max: Fury Road, because the trailers and the reviews for this movie have been off the walls mad. I mean five out of five star's! wow, just wow. The last Mad Max film came out in 1985, so it's a been a long time and so was this movie, as development took a long time. So I was curious and a bit shady for this movie, by seeing if George Miller (The director of the original films) was going to bring to the table. Now after seeing the movie and having a long thought about it, this movie is freaking awesome, no actually this is the best action movie of the year and probably the decade.\r\n\r\nGeorge Miller goes back to his roots and he doesn't disappointment. After all these years later he's still got it. He filmed all the action scenes with care and effort, because most of the action in this movie are mostly practical effects and that right there shows that Miller is going back to old school of action, and it's perfect. You are the man Miller!\r\n\r\nThe movie itself is mad and I do mean freaking insane. There's a guy in this movie who plays a flamethrower electric guitar on top of a speed vehicle and all through out the movie he was rocking it out. I don't know why, but little things like that made this movie so mad that it's enjoyable.\r\n\r\nTom Hardy as Max Rockatansky was good, I mean he wasn't as good as Mel Gibson but I still think he did a great job. Most of the time Max doesn't talk all that much, I mean most of he's lines are \"huh\", or \"Water\", but he has a couple of lines in the movie and it sounded epic all the time.\r\n\r\nCharlize Theron (as Furiosa) is basically the main character and Max is the supporting character. Charlize Theron was like a female version of Max in a way, because her character steels the whole show as her character is a strong female bad-ass that kicks so much ass that it's very rare in action movies today to do that. Now think of all the strong female character's in past action movies, well that's Furiosa right here.\r\n\r\nThe action scenes can be best describe as incredible and freaking crazy. The stunt work used during the movie was f**king amazing. There actually used practical effects mixed with CGI during the action scenes which looked so good and much better than over using effect's to make something look incredible and I know they used some CGI for scenes where it needed it, because it would be too dangerous or impossible to do, but for the most part it's all practical effect's. NOW THIS IS HOW ACTION MOVIES SHOULD BE DONE! THANK YOU MAD MAX: FURY ROAD FOR DOING THIS!!! Okay, I had to get that out there and sorry for shouting.\r\n\r\nImmortan Joe (played by Hugh Keays- Byrne), and yes he was in the first Mad Max movie, but here he plays a different villain this time and a menacing one as well. He was like a mix of Dark Vader and Sweet Tooth from Twisted Metal (Video Game). He was awesome villain that didn't take sh*t from anyone and always looked like he was going to cause a whole lot of trouble every time he's on screen.\r\n\r\nThe cinematography was just beautiful and some of the best looking shoots so far this year. I can't believe I'm saying that for a action movie that's been in development for years and it payed off perfectly. This is very rare for this to happen as a lot of movie franchises that have been in the making for years and years would normally come out to late where every body just lost interest and give up waiting, and the movie itself would turn out not so good, but here is much different. This movie broke new grounds of coming out late but still being a amazing thrill ride.\r\n\r\nThe other women in the movie know as the five wives are not just there to look pretty and be saved by any man, no they kicked ass in the movie and they actually did something. The five wives were strong women and this isn't just a mans movie, I mean most of the movie is the women kicking ass and being awesome. They kick more ass then Max ever did. That's why I got to give this movie praise for that.\r\n\r\nNow for the problems: I tried to look for things that didn't quite work for the movie and to be honest I couldn't find anything that I thought wasn't good. Well there was some slow parts in the movie but the slow parts where the action clams down for now it fills it's time with character development and back story and it worked.\r\n\r\nOverall rating: Forget \"Pitch Perfect 2\", this is the movie you should see at cinema. As a movie reviewer myself who wants action movies to be more then turn your brain off and enjoy whatever slob mess there in front of the screen, but what I want is a movie experience that I can look back on and say \"Now that, was one heck of a movie.\"",

Within this world exist two rebels on the run who just might be able to restore order.\r\n\r\nGeorge Miller directs and co-writes the screenplay with Brendan McCarthy and Nick Lathouris. It stars Tom Hardy, Charlize Theron, Nicholas Hoult, Hugh Keays-Byrne, Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, Zoë Kravitz, Josh Helman and Nathan Jones. Music is by Tom Holkenborg and cinematography by John Seale.\r\n\r\nWell it was a long time in the making, but finally a fourth Mad Max movie was made and it proves to be worth the wait. Undeniably light on plot, this essentially is a two hour chase movie played out to an apocalyptic backdrop of green skies, scorched orange and red vistas and the sort of storms that usually only come in nightmares. \r\n\r\nHundreds of crazily designed vehicles do untold damage to each other and to the barely human contingent - both goodies and baddies, the weaponary on show is vast and brutal, while the stunt work is breath taking. There's some narative stabs at redemptive force between Furiosa (Theron excellent) and Max (Hardy rightly restrained), but really this about high octane action and it's absolutely thrilling as Miller's camera work rarely sits still and brings all the carnage vividly to life.\r\n\r\nA petrol head's love poem in live action form and an action junkie's wet dream, Mad Max is back, and this time there's also a glorious female side-kick of considerable tough substance. 9/10",

George Miller produced an action movie on a scale, unlike anything I have ever seen. The effects were almost all practical, giving the movie a grit and realism that most films never reach due to the overuse of computer-generated effects. The budget for this movie had to be insane because the cost to make all these vehicles and explosions and crashes had to be astronomical! And so worth every penny. This movie is enrapturing and stunning! Mad Max: Fury Road personifies madness from the frantic camerawork to the editing style to Tom Hardy’s wild-eyed performance making this film intense, heart-pounding, and unpredictable. The world-building and screenplay are genius as well. The story doesn’t get caught up in explaining everything but instead throws the audience into the middle of this insane post-apocalyptic world, making them feel the same chaos as the characters on the screen. I could go on and on, but plain and simple - Mad Max: Fury Road is an action masterpiece that is worth seeing over and over again.",

From then on it's entertaining and I certainly enjoyed watching it all unfold. The action remains super effective and visually epic, the stunt work really is fantastic.\r\n\r\nHardy and Theron put in convincing showings, definitely an improvement on anything from the original trilogy in terms of the acting talent; no disrespect to those from the first three, it's just a noticeable upgrade for me. With all that noted, I still don't think the characters in these films are as strong as they could/should be (but still good) - and that's what probably stops me from utterly loving this.\r\n\r\nA prequel with Anya Taylor-Joy portraying Charlize Theron's character sounds great on paper, so I'm very much up for checking out <em>'Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga'</em> at some point soon!",

The absolute best parts are the interactions taking place within Venom himself (between Brock and the Symbiote) and the movie would have been a lot worse if Tom Hardy wasn't capable of pulling that off. Look, a _Venom_ movie probably should have been rated R, and it probably should have taken more notes from current superhero movies than superhero movies from fifteen years ago, but I still had a good time with _Venom_, maybe it's not the best possible version of the story, but I'm still glad we have this one.\r\n\r\n_Final rating:★★★ - I liked it.

It didn't have a lot of blood, but there was a bit here and there. Characters are mostly tossed around and beaten, but a lot of them are not shown dead. That being said, some characters are still killed on screen. People are experimented on. A few people are slashed and stabbed. Guns are used, but not frequently. It definitely pushed the PG-13 as far as it could. There is a lot of language throughout, including an f-bomb. There is also a lot of drinking. I definitely recommend this movie.

It cant decide wether its a goofy, action or a horror movie. Therefore its all of it and none at the same time. \r\n\r\nThe goofy jokes are pretty lame, which is why they are funny, you dont laugh with the writers, you laugh at them. \r\n\r\nThe action scenes are meh at best, \r\ncar chase : check\r\nmotorcycle : check\r\nridiculous (bad) cgi fight: check\r\nsure, watching Tom Hardy motorcross in San Francisco is quite fun, but its not really action. \r\n\r\nFinally, the horror; there are glimpses, glimmers of hope scattered around this movie. Little snippets of what could have been, but as soon as they appear they disappear. \r\n\r\nTwo scenes really stood out to me due to their potential. After quite a lot of buildup of Venom getting into the building (BY RUNNING UP IT), Eddie decides to take the lift down. Instead of having Eddie walk into the SWAT team, they should have been swarming the building crawling through the floors looking for him. Then, they could have had an ALIEN like hunting scene where Venom slowly takes out the task force one by one, in true horror movie fashion. \r\n\r\nThe other obvious horror scene could have been using the creepy little girl that delivers RIOT to the Musk wannabe, they could have homaged The Shining, they could have pulled an exorcist, they could have done a million things, but the little girl just has white pupils and a deep voice.\r\n\r\nThroughout the movie there are just continuous disappointments because you see what it is missing. \r\n\r\nInstead of the cheap love story and all the stupid overdone things they should have been ballsy with their movie. Yes the movie DID make 800+ million, however im sure it was going to do that anyway. Venom is probably one of the most badass characters in comic history, and Tom Hardy is Tom Hardy. \r\n\r\nI would have loved to see something along these lines:\r\n\r\nSymbiote hunts Eddie. \r\nSymbiote captures Eddie and they become Venom.\r\nVenom starts unleashing hell because he can, hunts SWAT etc. \r\nVenom goes after Musk wannabe and Kills him.\r\n\r\nThrow some more horror elements in there, and it would have made for a much more satisfactory watch. I have always adored Venom, and this movie had so much potential, but it was all for nothing. No rewatchability. Nothing worth remembering. Just a flick.\r\n\r\nIt was funny seeing Tom Hardy being a bit of a pussball, but even he cant help a crap script and an even worse film.",

              "content": "It’s school holidays here in France which means the kids are at my place which in turn means lot’s of time in front of the screen. Last night it was Venom’s turn to be plopped into my Blu-ray player.\r\n\r\nI have to say that I was a little disappointed. Sure it is a good movie and I did indeed enjoy it but not as much as I thought I would. According to the ratings it looked like the majority of the audience liked it a lot and I do like the character Venom. Sure the culture elite and politically correct idiots that Rotten Tomates use as “critics” claimed it to be rotten but, for me, that’s usually a good sign when it comes to my entertainment value from a movie.\r\n\r\nThe good things are that I found Venom, the creature, really cool. I liked his voice, his appearance and his no-nonsense attitude. The special effects and the action was very enjoyable to watch. Luckily that was my main reason for watching the movie. Actually, it is probably the main reason I want to watch any Marvel movie, especially lately given the poor quality of writers that Marvel has employed.\r\n\r\nI guess it is a plus as well that there was not too much politically correct, green or social preaching in it. I am sure those so inclined can find more than me if they go looking for it but most of the movie audience, at least not for this type of movie, probably could not care less.\r\n\r\nThe main reason I felt somewhat disappointed is that the main protagonist is really not someone I could feel like I would root for. He is such a despicable douche-bag. For starters he is a low life journalist with an overblown ego and disrespect of pretty much everything. The kind CNN would employ. Even when he’s been infected by Venom he continues between being a worthless egoistic coward and just an asshole. Actually the only real difference between the him and the big bad guy is that the bad guy is a hundred times more intelligent. It’s not until the very end scenes that Eddie develops a minimum of likability.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand Venom is really the star of the movie. Both as a “thing” and as a character. He is a real bad-ass, quite funny and really everything that Eddie should have been as a character. He even develops more as a character than previously mentioned douche-bag.\r\n\r\nIt’s a shame since otherwise this would have been a great movie. The story is simple but works well for this kind of movie. There are no silly twists and convoluted sub-plots. The main protagonist, as poor as he is, at least do not carry a lot of past history trying to explain God knows what and such stuff.\r\n\r\nIf the character of the main protagonist would have been more likable this would have been a great movie. Now it is “just” good.",

The actor carries the entire film, which finds its entertainment peak in the interactions between Eddie and Venom. \r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the movie is drastically brought down by a generic narrative with an incredibly dull first half, an unnecessary focus on uninteresting subplots, and a disappointing amount of paper-thin characters. The shockingly terrible editing basically ruins any sort of excitement that could be found during the action sequences. \r\n\r\nThe production issues condemned this film to be a letdown. Let's just hope the next one isn't worse.\"\r\n\r\nRating: C-",

              "content": "When audiences last saw Eddie Brock (Tom Hardy); the journalist and his parasitic symbiote Venom; had just saved the day and cemented their unusual bond with one another.\r\n\r\nIn the new film “Venom: Let There Be Carnage”; Eddie and Venom are at the end of their Honeymoon phase as Venom is lingering to be free to eat bad people and do what is natural for him. Eddie meanwhile wants a more conservative approach feeding Venom chicken and chocolate as he knows the eyes of the authorities are still upon him and he has to convince the world that Venom is dead and no longer a threat.\r\n\r\nAt the same time; serial killer Cletus Kasady (Woody Harrelson) has selected Eddie to interview him in San Quentin and the two form an unusual connection as Cletus cryptically speaks to Eddie which underlines a deeper motivation.\r\n\r\nWith the help of Venom; Eddie is able to decipher clues found on the walls of Cletus’s cell which leads authorities to several of his victims. This results in a rapid rise in status for Eddie and fast tracks Cletus for execution as his main means of leverage is now gone.\r\n\r\nThis leads to a rift where Eddie and Venom split and each has to struggle to adjust to life without one another.\r\n\r\nAt this point, the film has mainly been odd bits of whimsy between Venom and Eddie around the establishment of the plot and threat. However, things go into chaos mode when Cletus becomes infected with a Symbiote and turns into a destruction spewing death machine known as “Carnage”.\r\n\r\nCletus and Carnage both have their own agendas and Cletus uses Carnage to exact his revenge as well as locate a figure from his past that is as big a danger as he is.\r\n\r\nAs any fan of films of this genre knows; this scenario leads to a showdown between the central characters which are awash in abundant CGI, loud noises, and destruction. While this is not a bad thing and certainly one of the main reasons I enjoy films of this type; the film never seemed to fully click for me and as such was not as good as I thought it could have been.\r\n\r\nIn many ways, the film reminded me of how comic-based films were done before Marvel started their own studios and their phenomenal run of hits based on their work.\r\n\r\nThere have been multiple attempts to adapt comics into films over the last few decades and many of them have not lived up to expectations or failed outright. One of the biggest reasons is in my opinion is that those behind the projects were hindered by the studio, wanted to put their own spin on the material and strayed from the source; or failed to show the attributes that made the characters so appealing to fans.\r\n\r\nWhat we often get is action sequences and CGI galore but without stories or characters that fully draw in the audience and fail to capture the essence of the comics.\r\n\r\nDirector Andy Serkis has done a great job with the visuals of the film but the tone seems off. The early part of the film is filled with comedic moments that are either hit or miss. Some of which was almost to the point where I wondered if it was supposed to be a parody.\r\n\r\nThe plot is fairly linear with nothing unexpected as it is simply bad guys get loose; bad guys cause death and destruction, can the heroes stop them. The climactic scene lacks any “wow” moments for me as it was mainly CGI characters rapidly moving around causing damage to one another and their environment. There was no real tension for me and the ultimate resolution seemed a bit anti-climactic.\r\n\r\nFor me the best moment of the film was a mid-credits scene that really popped as it sets up all sorts of interesting options and indicates that Venom may be about to graduate to bigger and better things.\r\n\r\nFor now; the cast is solid as is the CGI; I just wish the story was more engaging as it had the potential to be so much more.\r\n\r\n3 stars out of 5",

The story regarding the birth of Carnage is different than the comic but works in the time they used to show this story.  The movie does not give a ton of back story on the dual villains in the story but they show the love they have for one another.  \r\n\r\nThe movie is short and very fast pace.  It also has plenty of comedy between the hosts and the symbiotes.  \r\n\r\nOverall the movie sets up for a Venom 3 and an inclusion of Venom into the MCU.  If the relationship between Sony & Marvel can continue to be good fans of the franchise will have a bright future ahead.",

How I wish more people would only appreciate how **( -Incredibly- )** difficult it is to emote for two -very- different entities, -near- simultaneously, that exist within just -{ ONE SINGLE }- body. 3 : Venom's \"Mardi-Gras Themed Nightclub Scene\". Simply stated, it's just absofreakinglutely -{ H I 💥 😂 - larious }. What's more, if you're a -passionate- progressive ( in real life ), like me, then you are almost -certain- to completely -{ Adore }- the 'horrible yet affable' Antihero's -equally- passionate appeal to stop \"Cruelty Against **ALIENS**\" . . . just a 'Glorious', ( albeit somewhat implicit ) message about the need to be -'Kinder'- to immigrants, documented or otherwise, delivered just -as- 'Gloriously' . . .

So here is perhaps -{ The }- most significant reason for -Why- that was the case, in my best estimation. Tom Hardy and Kelly Marcel, V2's storywriters . . . . -{ collectively }- lacked the requisite experience to rise to the indubitably -gargantuan- task of ( -Adequately- ) enthralling a whole -Planet- ; one that has now become -Altogether- used to watching 'PHENOMENALLY' entertaining Marvel fare, and there's really no other way to say it. Tom, ( whom I 'Admire To Death' as a -performer- , I definitely ought to point out here ), had only two✌ **-STORY-** writing credits to his name prior to V2 , with Kelly logging just three👌 . . . { counting 'Individual' TV Series, but -Not- counting 'Shorts' ( short films ), of course }. 3 : A \" MASSIVE \" Missed Opportunity : It is -indeed- not all that often that we see a quintessential 'Popcorn-blockbuster' flick make a -significant- effort to -Humanize- the villain by way of their -{ Early Childhood Experiences }- , no matter -how- evil they nay be shown as being. For V2 to first -very- SUCCESSFULLY achieve this with the \"Supremely\" prolific actor Woody Harrelson's 'Carnage' ...( finalé )... only to have said moment -Utterly- invalidated just a few cinematic beats later ( -you'll know when you see it- ) was quite the let down, 'Alas' 😔\r\n\r\n**C \" FINAL SUMMARY \" :** I have absolutely -{ N O }- doubt in my mind that had V2 been roughly 'a good 23 minutes' longer ( -At Least- , in order to make for a more \"Marvel-like\" runtime of Two-full-hours ) ; that I would have given it a mimimum score of '8 out of 10', without a moment's thought. -That- , in addition of course, to my \"Titular-gripe\" . . .

The film also boasts what feels like an accelerated pace that moves the story from action sequence to action sequence before coming to an end rather quickly, leaving _Venom: Let There Be Carnage_ to stand as one of those a special kind of stupid blockbuster endeavors that, every so often, strikes idiotic gold.\r\n\r\nThe sequel is a definite improvement over the first film in the sense that it totally embraces its stupidity resulting in a comic book film that feels light, silly, and amusingly psychotic all at the same time.\r\n\r\n**Full review:** https://boundingintocomics.com/2021/10/05/venom-let-there-be-carnage-review-idiotic-gold/",

              "content": "I'm gonna give this Venom movie a not so great rating.  I still love the character.  Venom is the quintissential anti-hero.  Once a bad guy (though not in this universe apparently) he now tries to do the right thing while keeping within acceptable norms to exist among humans.  \r\nThis movie was a good attempt but, it came across as contrived and a bit cookie cutter as far as the bad guys, Woody Harrelson and Naomi Harris, were portrayed.  Psychoes enjoying newfound freedom after a fail death sentence, and lifelong incarceration is soooooo....bland.  In short, \"It's been done (before).\"  \r\n\r\nThe story from there is hit 'n miss with comedy, plot, and tension.  The movie pretty much happens in that manner as well.  It jumps as if each of the scenes are little movies banded together with no smooth transitions : Hardy really needs to workout or pass the character to someone else; his age is showing.  Harrelson and Harris' characters really didn't mesh, the half deaf cop never really fit into the story, we didn't hear enough from Carnage, and Venom's night out didn't actually go anywhere.  \r\n\r\nThe vibe of the movie felt clunky.\r\n\r\nI'll always like Venom.  But this was not particularly thrilling.  There is mixed opinion on which of the two movies is better.  I'll have to fall into the camp of those who liked the first Venom movie.  The second, more than not, simply let me down.  So, I will wait and see if another company can do better with the character than its predecessors.  3/5 stars.",

The entertaining elements from the first film, the humour and - dare I say it, the symbiotic relationship/tolerance of man and amoeba are thrown under the bus for this angry CGI fest. Add to this pretty dry mix the rather pointless character of Harrelson's childhood sweetheart \"Frances\" (Naomie Harris) alias \"the Scream\" (remember the symbiotes don't like fire of sound), with her own agenda against copper \"Mulligan\" (Stephen Graham) and the whole thing just boils down to a very good looking film - but one with a plot that was almost non-existent, and that robbed the formidably sarcastic \"Venom\" of much of the charm that made the original work. Come to think on it - Hardy hardly features at all. I didn't hate it - it has a pace that passes 90 minutes effortlessly enough, but sorry, I was really disappointed.",

              "content": "    As a child, I remember catching David Lynch’s “Dune” on TV. I was too young to really understand the plot at the time, but I didn’t care, all I knew was that the worms were awesome. When I got a little older, I read the book for my first time. It was the first “adult” book I read on my own, and I was in love with it ever since. I read it many more times growing up, and when the miniseries came out, I watched and recorded it every night, then re-watched it time and time again. When “Children of Dune” aired, I again devoured it happily. In the case of the Lynch film, as I grew, I of course began to see more and more of the flaws, though I personally hold the “Spicediver Edit” in quite high esteem. That particular cut of the film manages to make the Lynch version into what is a genuinely good film, but still imperfect. The miniseries has, up until now, remained my preferred adaptation. Now we have a new adaptation: Denis Villeneuve’s “Dune”, and it certainly is quite different from the previous two versions in many ways, but is it good? Well, at least from my perspective, that answer is complicated. The short version is yes, it is a good film, but it’s not a great one.\r\n\r\n    The gist of the story is straightforward. Many, many millennia in the future, Paul, the son of the Duke Leto Atreides, finds himself and his family caught in plots of intrigue, and betrayal, after taking custody of a new and valuable planet. In order to survive, he finds that he will have to depend on the training of his mother, the Lady Jessica, the help of the planets local population, the fremen, and his growing awareness of a great, yet possibly terrible destiny that waits for him. \r\n\r\n    In reality though, the story is anything but. The novel is infamous for being “unadaptable” with its complex “plots within plots” storyline, along with its sheer size. There is simply too much going on in the story to make it easy to turn into a film, or even a series. The previous efforts have all brought different aspects of the novel to the forefront, and this new version is no different. In broad strokes, it is perhaps the most faithful to the novel in terms of themes, and it certainly emphasizes some aspects of the political commentary behind the novel, such as the missionaria protectiva, which was nowhere to be found in the Lynch film, and only really hinted at in the miniseries. They also spend a little more time focusing on the fremen and their sentiments toward off-worlders after living under the Harkonnen regime, but unfortunately, while it is nice to see these themes in the film, they are undercut by little development. In fact, the entire film suffers on that front. So much of the political context and scheming has been left out that the film as presented feels somehow empty. \r\n\r\n    Early in the film, it is established that the emperor considers the Duke Leto a threat due to his popularity, but never really explores too much beyond it. Even more strangely, the film establishes this, but then later makes it seem like they were never really certain about the fact that the emperor was involved in a key scene, unlike the book, where the Duke was fully aware that they were heading into a trap, and was attempting to outmaneuver his political opponents. The Baron Harkonnen is limited to a few admittedly atmospheric scenes where he more or less confirms the emperor is aiding him in their goal to destroy the Atreides line, but it is reduced to a few scant lines, the bare minimum necessary to understand the plot. This, unfortunately results in very shallow characterization, and the same problem runs throughout the film. Gurney Halleck, Thufir Hawat, and Doctor Yueh are all present, but each of them is only given a small handful of scenes, in which they only speak a few lines each, before they are forgotten to focus on Paul, or beautiful scenic shots. They never feel like fully realized characters in the film, more as brief supporting roles, whom are only present in order to fulfill their roles in the larger storyline. Thufir Hawat receives perhaps the worst treatment in this regard. Even the primary cast are not given a lot of development. We are given enough to know who they are, and a little of their personality, but nothing more. It seems strange, that the longest adaptation of the first half of the novel ever made should have less detail and character than either previous version. It does however, and it certainly hurts the film as a result. Long, moody shots are great, but only when they exist in addition with actual depth. The plot of the film has been streamlined to the point that it feels watered-down, and genuinely wastes the talents of its cast all stuck in roles that have been similarly effected. \r\n\r\n    There are also a few key scenes that actively go against things covered in the book. One scene features the Lady Jessica speaking of secretive matters regarding the bene gesserit sisterhood while sitting in the cockpit of an ornithopter right behind Thufir Hawat, whom would be easily able to hear everything she had just said. Another moment, involves the Reverend Mother Mohiam referring to Jessica as Leto’s “wife”, even though she would know full well that they aren’t married. Yet another moment involves that Shadout Mapes pulling out a crysknife to offer it to Jessica while out in the open, and Jessica is in the presence of guards. The Shadout later sheathes the knife unblooded, and those who have read the book will know why that choice does not work for the film, especially in the context of fremen later being shown cutting themselves before sheathing their knives. Of course, in any adaptation there will be liberties taken, and there are indeed more, but these three moments in particular certainly seem to stand out the most in regards to actively going against aspects of the original novel, and in doing so, hurt this film as an adaptation.\r\n\r\n    With that said, there were things I liked as well. As I have stated a number of times, the film is gorgeous. There are a couple of scenes that certainly seemed to be more “style over substances”, such as a shot of ships rising from the ocean for… no apparent reason, but man do they look beautiful. There is also a very real sense of scale in the film that I can freely admit neither previous version ever accomplished. As a result, there are a few scenes that do far better match their description in the book, and are glorious to watch.\r\n\r\n    I do really appreciate the way they portray the emperor, discussed, but never seen. A powerful force that can be felt looming in the background, his hand guiding everything happening. He is built up excellently, and I will be curious to see how well he is portrayed if we get a sequel. In the previous adaptations, he was prominently displayed and used to provide greater context for the politics of the story, but in the book, he is only ever seen in the end, and keeping book accurate in this case certainly works very well.\r\n\r\n    The film also features the most book accurate version of Paul’s growing prescience, hinting at possible outcomes rather than complete premonitions. The way it is executed is not necessarily without its flaws, or heavy-handedness in a couple of moments, but it works well. Similarly, we also get the story of the bull and Leto’s father for the first time, though the film attempts to make the bull symbolic in a manner I am not sure really works, or is earned.　Also notable is the death of a significant character finally matching their death in the novel. \r\n\r\n    I have also stated that the cast does a great job, and I stand by that. In the entire film, there is not a bad performance in the film. My only complaint would be with the portrayal of the Lady Jessica, who comes across as too emotional, presumably in an attempt to show her ability to shift from being upset to being entirely refined and composed in moments, but that is a matter of writing rather than performance. When it comes to the casting, I personally felt that many of the actors matched their roles well, in particular enjoying the casting of Duke Leto and the Baron. I did not however care much for the gender-swapping of Liet, which served no real purpose, especially when one considers how small the characters role was in this version of the film, though Sharon Duncan-Brewster did a good job with what she had. I also did not care for the casting of Rebecca Ferguson as Jessica. While she is a very good actress, she seemed to me a bit too “girl next door”, rather than the character from the novel that the Duke Leto notes “reintroduced regality into the Atreides line”. \r\n\r\n    When it comes to the score, I will admit that I was not certain how I would feel in regards to Hans Zimmer’s work on the film. The samples I had heard up until this point had been interesting, but I was not sure how it would work in terms of the film itself. I can say that it works well, though there are moments when it feels almost as watered-down as the plot itself. It never really allowed me to feel excited at any point, but it did match the tone of the film very well, and I can easily see myself turning it on whenever I clean my house in order to set a “mood” (Ha! See what I did there?). \r\n\r\n    In conclusion, despite my criticisms, I did enjoy the film. I think it works well enough to be understood, though there may be some moments where the average viewer could find themselves feeling confused. It certainly is a visual spectacle, but one undercut by excessive trimming of detail and world-building. I hope it is successful enough to warrant a sequel in order to finish the story, but I also find that I will not be upset if it does not. As adaptations go, this is no “The Lord of the Rings”. In the end, I have to rate this version of “Dune” closer to the original Lynch film, and maintain the miniseries as my favorite adaptation of an amazing novel.",

              "content": "I'll open by saying I am not a fan of Villeneuve. In fact, I think he's a hack whose only genuine talent is making stupid people falsely think they are actually quite smart. I am also a HUGE Dune fan. They have been my favourite series of books since I first discovered them as a teenager. So although I hoped for the best with this, I was expecting the worst. What I got was somewhere in the middle. It's an OK movie, not great, thankfully not terrible, but OK\r\n\r\nIt got some things right the 1984 Lynch version got wrong, but still somehow managed to get other stuff wrong (including stuff Lynch got right). It was also a surprise how much Villeneuve just lifted directly from the Lynch film, both visually and auditorily.\r\n\r\nThe wardrobe choices were a huge disappointment. If you didn't know the time setting, going just on the clothes in the new Dune you'd be forgiven for thinking it was set a mere forty or fifty years (if that) in the future rather than the twenty thousand years in the future when it's really set. The Lynch stillsuits look futuristic, unworldly, and something that really would keep you alive in the deep desert. The new desert wear looks like they are just going to go dirt biking for an hour or two in our present-day world.\r\n\r\nThe casting (completely ignoring the pointless gender swap) was good, However, with the exception of Paul, Chani, and Rabban the original casting was all better. But the original (apart from the odd decision to use the totally unsuited Kyle MacLachlan) was a masterclass in how to cast the perfect people for the role.\r\n\r\nAnyway, enough of the comparisons, This film is about the first two-thirds of the first novel. I always thought the story would be better told via a big-budget TV series (or even mini-series) rather than a standalone movie. I still think what they tried to cover here was too much for a single movie, but it was a step in the right direction.\r\n\r\nThe film mainly sticks to the book story but does make some needless changes, the most obvious of which being the changes made to both the gender and story of Liet Kynes, which in turn impacts the story of Chani. Most other changes are small and mainly insignificant though.\r\n\r\nThe film being filmed in Norway, Jordan, and Abu Dhabi looks fantastic and very well suited to the large screen. And it's clear a great deal of time, effort, and money was put into the sets that looked equally good as the places they were meant to be.\r\n\r\nThe acting was of a suitably high standard, but unfortunately, many of the Dune names and terms were horribly mispronounced. That and the Hans Zimmer fart that is played constantly throughout the soundtrack is likely to pull people out of their emersion in the movie.\r\n\r\nI was also somewhat surprised by what was left out, OK the source material is VERY dense and obviously some needed to be cut, but I don't really think it's made clear just how crucial melange is to the functioning of the empire and society as a whole. Also what (and why) mentats are is largely ignored, you may think that isn't overly important, but it is at the core of how many things are done in the Dune universe.\r\n\r\nOver all, it's not a bad movie. Despite its flaws, I still think the 1984 Lynch version is better though.",

Not exactly awesome. I didn’t like how they quickly killed off all the good guys except for Paul and his mom (okay, yeah that is definitely a spoiler). Plus I thought it weird that during the big battle scene we have awesome bombs and complex tracer missiles flying about, but on the ground we have merely well-choreographed hand-to-hand fighting with knives and swords. Couldn’t the folks who invented the missile come up with a pistol? Or am I being picky?",

              "content": "I read Frank Herbert's book, Dune, when I was in high school and really don't remember it much except that it was great and a little scary. At that age, I probably didn't get the subtext message.\r\n\r\nI never saw any movies of it so I decided to watch both the 1984 Dune by David Lynch and the 2021 Denis Villeneuve version sequentially. I'm going to talk about both of them here.\r\n\r\nThis may not be a popular opinion: Lynch's version is **brilliant** and the Villeneuve Dune is absolute **shit**. Here's why:\r\n\r\nFirst, is the Villeneuve Dune slick? Yes, absolutely. I should hope so considering it's nearly 40 years after Lynch did his, for crissake.\r\n\r\nAre the character's in David Lynch's version kitschy and over the top? Yes! That's one reason it's so much better! It's Sci Fi, duh! You watch Marvel movies and suspend disbelief for incredible, imaginary super powers? All of Lynch's characters are downright gritty and believable within this particular surreal fantasy.\r\n\r\nBy the end of the Lynch Dune, I had sympathy for nearly every character in the film. Even the villains caught my emotions. Paul Atreides character development was realistic and attractive.\r\n\r\nVilleneuve's characters? I felt like my neighbor came over and asked, \"Hey, can you come to watch my kid's junior high school play?\" \"Sure, Denis, just let me fill my 1-liter flask with tequila first.\"\r\n\r\nVilleneuve's characters were so damned flat and lifeless that they evoked NO emotional response whatsoever. Although I occasionally sit through a bad flick, I can't remember recently watching a movie as awful character-wise, as the 2021 Dune. If I were an actor on that set, I would be silently screaming. How does a director even do this?\r\n\r\nOh, and where's the creativity? It's 46 years since George Lucas founded Industrial Light & Magic, and Denis can't create one single, new, goddamn space machine 46 years later? (One could argue the hummingbird copter is new, but it's not so creative when you realize that we didn't even know how hummingbird wings actually worked until this millennia.)\r\n\r\nBut here's the real clincher: the screenplay. David Lynch gave us a complete story. Sadly, he didn't have the final cut and disowned his film when the critics panned it. Despite the fact that Lynch is a true artist and genius, the studio took 45 minutes out of the film. 45 minutes! Even ruined by the studio, even 40 years later, Lynch's film has a clear vision and carries the timeless message that Frank Herbert intended. I would LOVE to see the original cut!\r\n\r\nVilleneuve, on the other hand, stopped abruptly in the middle of the book. I now realize that Denis is not about the story. Denis is all about the franchise money, and that sucks. As a result of the bad screenplay, this 2021 version doesn't even carry the socio-political statement it was supposed to have. I want my 155 minutes back.\r\n\r\nI don't watch Part 2s, especially when it comes to void-of-creativity and void-of-character-development Hollywood movies. You can take your bad franchise and shove it up your sci fi black hole.\r\n\r\nAdmittedly, I loved Blade Runner 2049, but this is so disappointing, I may never watch another Villeneuve film again. Do yourself a favor and see David Lynch's version of Dune.",

              "content": "I was really eager to watch this movie and at the same time a wee bit concerned because I knew that I would be hugely disappointed if it turned out to be another movie massacring a classic source material.\r\n\r\nI have to admit that it was a very long time since I read the Dune books but I have to say that the movie was mostly true to the books, as I remember them, and also reasonably free of agenda driven rubbish apart from the odd replacement of some characters with “gender correct” ones for no real good reason.\r\n\r\nThere is really not much point in me saying much about the story. It should be well known for any science fiction fan and it is a great story and really good material for a big screen movie despite some “critics” at Rotten Tomatoes moaning about it and calling it unwieldly etc. Probably too big a book with too many words for the small, agenda driven, brains of Rotten Tomatoes “critics”. No surprise there.\r\n\r\nThe movie as a whole is wonderful to watch, the scenery is oftentimes very beautiful and the décor, the buildings, the machinery is very well done. I was surprised that the world of Caladan was portrayed as a rather austere Scottish looking landscape but after getting over the initial surprise it worked very well actually.\r\n\r\nI also like that the Harkonnen, especially the Baron, are not turned into some exaggerated comical figures but, although disgusting and despicable, they are actual humans.\r\n\r\nOverall the casting was quite good and everyone played their roles well. At the beginning I felt that Paul was a bit too wimpy, from what I remember of the book he was quite well trained and skilled already from the start, but he picked up as the movie went along.\r\n\r\nIt is a science fiction, borderline fantasy, movie so there should be some special effects, right? This is a difficult movie to make special effects for since this universe is a weird mix between futuristic science fiction, fantasy elements and old-fashioned traditions.\r\n\r\nI have to say that they succeeded quite well though. The atmosphere felt just right, ships, spice harvesters, buildings looked cool and fitting the story. The way they implemented the personal shields was very nice. They didn’t go overboard on special effects and weird designs. The ornithopter was of course totally ridiculous from a scientific point of view but at least it looked pretty cool.\r\n\r\nIf I should complain about something, although that is not the fault of the movie but of the source material, I have never understood how, in a universe which is obviously driven by hidden agendas, machinations and assassinations, the Atreides could just pick up everything, leave their home and put all their important eggs in one basket at Arrakis.\r\n\r\nOne more small thing that I could complain about would of course be that we now have to wait two years, from what I have read, until we get to watch the next movie to get to the part were the really cool stuff happens.\r\n\r\nBottom line, this was movie is definitely in there vying for the title “best movie that I have watched this year”.",

              "content": "_Dune_ was a massive undertaking due to the sheer amount of lore and political backstory director Villeneuve had to fit in a two-and-a-half-hour run-time, but I am happy to say it was executed brilliantly.\r\n\r\nThe story of _Dune_ is incredibly deep, there are so many layers of political factions and relationships that it can get quite confusing at times. I had to constantly be looking up specific individuals and their ties to each other to understand the minor nuances of the story. Despite that fact, Villeneuve is still able to deliver a coherent narrative that will allow the majority of the audience to understand the overarching plot. After the buildup of the first act, the story gets cooking, and I was utterly invested.\r\n\r\nThere is an incredible atmosphere present in this film. It begins as a Sci-Fi epic, following a house starting anew on a fresh planet and a new industry to conquer. You can feel the optimism and the sense of discovery in the shots due to the interesting angles, lighting, and a brilliant soundtrack composed by Hans Zimmer. But as the narrative evolves so does the tone, as a thick fog of helplessness bleeds on to the screen and you can feel the dread form. This tone was quite refreshing in today’s blockbuster cinema, as each movie needs to incorporate a vast amount of unnecessary comedy to appeal to the broader audience. Dune is unapologetic about what the story is trying to deliver and gives you exactly what it wants without any concessions.\r\n\r\nThe visuals are stunning throughout the entire runtime. One of my favorite scenes was during the spice extraction visit. I loved the blend of realism that was used in this Science Fiction setting. The ships and equipment look like they could exist in our own world with a few technological advancements. The fight choreography is really well done, especially the hand-to-hand combat. The final scene was epic, each fist and punch were so sharp and calculated, it was really impressive to watch in the age of jump cut action.\r\n\r\nThe acting is perfect throughout the film, I really cannot point to any one character that felt off or out of place. Timothee Chalamet did an incredible job as the lead man. He delivered a heartfelt performance and evolved throughout the entire film into the confident leader the story crashendos on. Rebecca Ferguson, Oscar Isaac, and Josh Brolin all did great jobs as well. I really brought the somewhat complex nature of Lady Jessic and Duke Leto, they had really great chemistry with themselves and with their son. Stellan Skarsgard had my favorite performance of the entire film. I felt entirely disgusted everytime he was on the screen, and he made the hairs on the back of my neck stand tall. He is truly a man poisoned by greed and will not stop at anything on his path to fortune. Jason Momoa does a fantastic job here too. I felt he really fit his role and his lines were delivered effortlessly, much better than his performance in the DCEU.\r\n\r\n_Dune_ delivers a fantastic Sci-Fi epic that gave me everything I was looking for and I will be eagerly awaiting the sequel's release.\r\n\r\n**Score:** _88%_\r\n\r\n**Verdict:** _Excellent_",

The cast was top-notch, and the scale that Denis Villeneuve evoked in every scene was breathtaking. From the moment, Dune starts, it demands a sequel through its world-building, acting, and storylines leaving the audience wanting answers (the fact that it literally begins with the words \"Part One\" helps too). I can't wait to see what comes next!",

              "content": "My thoughts on the latest Dune movie are a bit mixed. I walked into the theater without much knowledge of the story, which left me a bit confused at the start. However, as the movie progressed, it felt like a mix of Star Wars and Tremors, which was intriguing.\r\n\r\nTimothée Chalamet is one of my top three favorite actors, and he didn't disappoint in this film. Alongside him, Rebecca Ferguson delivered a stellar performance, portraying a queen-like character with grace. The movie boasted an impressive cast from various backgrounds, adding depth to the story.\r\n\r\nVisually, the film was stunning, with planes resembling dragonflies and captivating scenes. Yet, I found it challenging to follow the plot entirely, leaving me with many unanswered questions. While enjoyable to watch, it lacked a clear setup for a potential sequel, which was a bit disappointing.\r\n\r\nZendaya's role, heavily promoted, turned out to be minimal, which may disappoint fans. On the other hand, seeing Jason Momoa and Dave Bautista in different roles was refreshing, showcasing their versatility as actors. The portrayal of Chalamet as a Jesus-like figure felt a bit forced but didn't overshadow the overall experience.\r\n\r\nDespite its flaws, I believe Dune has the potential to evolve into a successful franchise if given the chance. While it may not have matched the wow factor of some other first films in franchises, it's worth a watch for its cinematic experience. I'd rate it a six out of ten, with Chalamet and Ferguson stealing the show with their stellar performances.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, Dune is a movie worth watching, especially on the big screen. It has the elements to become a long-lasting franchise, but its success ultimately depends on audience reception. Give it a chance and see for yourself the potential this film holds.",

My interest did wane slightly at roughly the middle part, as was similarly the case with the first film in truth, but that was a feeling that only lasted for a relativiely short time.\r\n\r\nAll in all, it's fantastic. The acting is top notch, the visuals are breathtaking <em>(those sandworms tho)</em> and the score is outstandingly hefty - you can always rely on the great Hans Zimmer! Timothée Chalamet stars yet again, as do the likes of Rebecca Ferguson, Zendaya, Dave Bautista & Co. The person I actually enjoyed most on screen was Javier Bardem, who is truly brilliant throughout. \r\n\r\nBring on <em>'Dune Messiah'</em>! On that note, happy to read that director Denis Villeneuve has noted that he won't be rushing that one out - and rightly so!",

              "content": "This is certainly a great looking film to see on a big screen with some really effective, almost industrially sounding, audio - but what happened to the story? It's wafer thin and really stretched out for 2¾ hours. We pick up with \"Paul\" (Timothée Chalamet) and his mother (Rebecca Ferguson) trying to convince the \"Fremen\" that they are worth the hassle. Fortunately, leader \"Stilgar\" (Javier Bardem) is convinced of the messianic state of the young refugee, whilst their own reverend mother is on her last legs which might give \"Jessica\" a chance to prove her own worth, and provide an opportunity to peddle some embellished mythology about her son's ascendant propheteering. All of this manoeuvring and politicking is having quite an impact on \"Chani\" (the under-used Zendaya) and on the relationship between her and the increasingly worshipped new Duke. Meantime, now fully reinvigorated and emerged from his bath of recuperative Guinness, the evil \"Baron Harkonnen\" (an almost Zeppelin-like Stellan Skarsgård) has recruited his lethal nephew \"Feyd-Rautha\" (Austin Butler) to get to grips with the rebellion on \"Arrakis\" that is bringing him into the gaze of an ill-satisfied emperor (Christopher Walken). Battle lines are drawn! Now whilst I did enjoy this, the rest of the film is a gloriously photographed but slowly paced hybrid of \"Khartoum\" (1966) and \"Lawrence of Arabia\" (1962) with a bit of the \"Phantom Menace\" (1999) thrown in for good measure. The acting is adequate but the characterisations are all too routinely sacrificed at the altar of the stunning visuals and from about an hour to go, I was convinced this this was but part two of three (or maybe even more). Walken and Charlotte Rampling feature all too sparingly to make much difference, indeed even Zendaya's warrior-like tendencies seem to have been neutered rather and I though that Chalamet just tried far too hard to imbue his character with a strength that he was far more successful with first time round. That said, it does work well enough as a classy and well produced sci-fi adventure with plenty of action and mysticism but I needed more meat on it's bones. I still get distinctly squeamish when I watch what they do with the water, let alone where they get it from!!",

              "content": "As a big sci-fi/fantasy fan, I generally look forward to seeing new releases in this genre. However, when the first part of this story was released in 2021, I was sorely disappointed by this tedious, overlong slog that, despite its stunning visuals and cinematography, never really engaged me. Though, for all my disappointment with the initial installment, it can’t begin to compare to my reaction to “Part Two” – an even more tedious, unengaging, overly complicated offering that had me bored by 20 minutes in. I found myself not caring a whit about the characters or their story (which could have used a scorecard to help viewers sort out everything), and even the supposedly superior visuals of this iteration failed to capture my attention or interest. I can only conclude that I must be missing something, given the generally positive reactions and accolades this film and its predecessor have received, but I’m mystified that I haven’t yet figured out what. By all rights, the elements would appear to be in place here to make this picture succeed – a stellar cast, great special effects and the skillful directing of filmmaker Denis Villeneuve, who created such excellent works as “Arrival” (2016) and “Blade Runner 2049” (2017) – but “Part Two,” like its predecessor, just never grabbed me. To be honest, I’m truly surprised that I made it all the way through, considering the nearly constant temptation to want to fast-forward through the egregiously dull sequences (of there were many). From all this, I can only surmise that this film and the one that preceded it were created simply to milk as much box office money as possible out of the source material, despite the fact that the story isn’t captivating enough to live up to that challenge. Indeed, if you’re like me and found the first part boring, you’ll probably find this one even more tiresome and lackluster (I’m certainly glad that I waited for this one to come to streaming and didn’t waste my money on theater ticket prices). And now, as I understand it, another sequel, “Dune: Messiah,” is in pre-production to continue a story that has still yet to reach conclusion after more than five hours of screentime. Be aware that the “Dune” films are far from the quality of other lengthy trilogies like the “Lord of the Rings” and “Dark Knight” series, films that definitely hold viewer interest from start to finish. Instead, “Dune” and “Dune: Part Two” are more like such mind-numbing stand-alone offerings as “Heaven’s Gate” (1980), “Ishtar” (1987) and “Tenet” (2020) than anything of a genuinely epic nature. Treat the hype for this one with a hefty grain of salt, and don’t say you weren’t warned.",

While the film is long and dialogue-heavy, it manages to deliver a compelling story despite the limited action sequences.\r\n\r\nTimothée Chalamet shines in his role, though at times, his character may feel overshadowed by the ensemble cast. Florence Pugh's character, on the other hand, seems to lack a clear purpose, appearing intermittently throughout the film without a defined role.\r\n\r\nRebecca Ferguson delivers a standout performance as the mother figure, commanding attention whenever she appears on screen. The dynamic between Josh Brolin and Dave Bautista offers a humorous nod to their previous roles, adding an entertaining element to the movie.\r\n\r\nZendaya's character receives more screen time than in the previous installment, but her role remains secondary to the overarching plot. Austin Butler's portrayal, while intriguing, is hindered by sparse dialogue and an unusual vocal delivery reminiscent of an \"evil Elvis.\"\r\n\r\nAs a middle installment in a trilogy, \"Dune Part 2\" serves as a foundation for character development and plot progression. While it may not be as action-packed as some viewers expect, it sets the stage for the anticipated climax in the final film of the series.\r\n\r\nOverall, \"Dune Part 2\" is a worthwhile watch for those invested in the franchise, offering a rich and immersive cinematic experience. With the promise of a third installment on the horizon, the intricate world of \"Dune\" is poised to deliver a satisfying conclusion to the story.",

              "content": "Alongside _Weekend_ and _Moonlight_, _Call Me By Your Name_ is the greatest queer film I have seen in the past ten years. It's a gorgeous, quiet masterwork - Luca Guadagnino has given us something truly special here. I'll cherish this one for a long, long time as it's extremely human and very personal. The fact that the legendary James Ivory wrote the screenplay for this shoots this over the top and slam dunks it into the cinematic stratosphere. Truly stunning work that deserves to be remembered, preserved, and celebrated for decades to come.\r\n\r\nThe performances in this are so mesmerizing. I've never liked Armie Hammer as much as I like him in this. He really embodies his character and it's a lived in, fully realized performance. Timothée Chalamet - who has a great year ahead of him with other big projects - is absolutely captivating as the young lead in this coming-of-age tale. I've seen many a coming-of-age film, but this one is one of the truest portrayals of a gay youth coming to terms with his sexuality, emotions, and his own body.\r\n\r\nThere are so many phenomenal scenes, but the one that stands out above the rest - and the one that made me cry in a theatre full of festivalgoers - is Michael Stuhlbarg's final monologue. It's one of the most honest and real moments I've seen in any film and one of the best father and son moments too. Crossing my fingers so hard that this becomes a huge critical darling and garners some attention come awards time (specifically for Guadagnino, Ivory, Chalamet, and Stuhlbarg).\r\n\r\nOh, and bonus points for that final shot of Chalamet's face as the credits roll. It's the best of its kind since Glazer's _Birth_ in 2004 when Nicole Kidman shattered all of our souls. Chalamet does the same thing here and it's overwhelmingly stunning.",

              "content": "Amidst some beautiful Italian rusticity, we are introdcued to the \"Perlman\" family. It's the father (Michael Stuhlbarg) who has employed American \"Oliver\" (Armie Hammer) to help out with some research, and that involves living-in with his family of wife \"Annella\" (Amira Casar) and teenage son \"Elio\" (Timothée Chalamet) at their villa. Initially, they just call him \"later\" as that's his most often used expression as he takes his leave, but gradually they take to this man who appears to have depths that bely his slightly friendly but diffident attitude. It's the young \"Elio\" who seems most smitten. He's only seventeen but has a maturity that seems beyond his years as he uses his own substantial polyglot intellect to engage with their visitor. Though he's flirting like mad with his childhood friend \"Marzia\" (Esther Garrel) it's quite clear that his relationship with \"Oliver\" is passing the infatuation stage and heading into uncharted territory for both men - and the onlooking parents. With the sun shining, the wine flowing and the swimming tempting, Luca Guadagnino now takes us on a beautifully crafted story that is more than a rite of passage, or a typical \"coming of age\" drama - it's a love story that I felt at times was joyous and optimistic and yet, ultimately, somewhat cruel. The outwardly confident \"Elio\" has been raised in a loving and tactile family environment and so finds this emotional exposure he now faces both exhilarating and terrifying, and the sylphlike Chalamet really does deliver that vulnerability - and playfulness - like an experienced hand, whilst Hammer walks a path that I was never quite sure of. Is he just playing games with the young man, does he really care? Is it all just to pass the time during his visit or it it more? The location settings are gorgeous and the combination of a sparing script from James Ivory and some poignantly mixed musical themes ranging from Bach to Giorgio Moroder contribute to an aesthetic that is both ideally sheltering and yet hot-blooded at the same time. This is a film that seems to get better with age, and for just over two hours we are immersed in something that's really quite natural.",

              "content": "Undoubtedly still awful viewing, but... I found it a tiny bit more watchable than its predecessor.\r\n\r\n<em>'365 Days: This Day'</em> still has nothing that even closely resembles a plot, still has extremely limited actors and still shouldn't even exist. However, I'd be lying if I said I disliked it as much as the 2020 original. It's almost like taking out the sexual violence actually makes it more digestable, who'd a thunk it?!\r\n\r\nUnlike that other release, this falls into the more common category of just simply being rubbish. I will say, though, the music kinda slaps. The film is pretty much comprised of a series of sexual music videos placed back-to-back-to-back. Some of music used is well chosen I can't deny, I Shazam'd a couple... admittedly that probably says more about my taste in music than anything else!  ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯\r\n\r\nThere's even some minor neat cinematography, too. The positives I note are minimal, though, and don't overly help this 2022 production. I have more negatives, which also include an overlong run time and that shoddy ending. At least it marginally improves upon the film it follows, I wonder if its own sequel will do likewise? I plan to find out!",

The male lead looks as if the coke delivery from the wholesaler hasn't arrived, she's naked again. And then, wow, that look - like someone fell asleep on Instagram's sepia filter slider. Everything looks so beautifully even.\r\n\r\nIn addition, the lovely sounds of the best that the German charts have to offer jingle from positions 58 to 72. Is it always the same song? Or lots of them that always sound the same? Is it even music or has someone kicked the neighbor's cat in the shin again? I don't know it. But no time to think. One of the mega hot soft sex games is just beginning, which is always really nasty and unpleasant.\r\n\r\nIt's sooo romantic. She says “Fuck me”, he says nothing as usual, but his look has now changed from a coke hit to a stroke. And then he licks it. Oh, great. With the whole tongue, once across the face and the adjacent table leg. Luckily, the endless banter is filmed in super slow motion, so the torture...cinematic ecstasy lasts much, much longer.\r\n\r\nSuddenly he says... no, that's not true, he doesn't say anything. We only speak here in emergencies. Even if there's probably some kind of mafia plot being told, which I overlooked in all the constant fucking around. Unfortunately, I didn't understand who all these people were until the end. Well, of course it's stupid that I didn't see the first part, but it's also a little bit unusual that this sequel doesn't make any effort to give these characters any depth. Or to explain what is actually going on here. Is anything even going on? Well, it doesn't matter. The guys are supposed to be cute and the women are supposed to be persistent and stupid. And oh - they start slobbering on each other again 😍😍😍\r\n\r\n————\r\n\r\n“365 Days - This Day” is like “Fifty Shades of Gray” for sexually frustrated amoebas like Dr. RTL2's summer question page is filmed as if the Netflix executive suite was personally shitting in your brain, in slow motion. Infuriatingly misogynistic, absurdly badly acted and of course at number 1 on the Netflix charts. When is there a power outage when you need one?",

Across the whole run time, I think there's less sex than usual - that's not to say there isn't sex, there's plenty, but it seemed slightly less constant.\r\n\r\nThe only pluses, albeit very minor ones, I have are basically the same as before: it uses decent music and has some solid shots spattered in there. They remain pointless in their existence and very much overstay their welcome, yet I kinda couldn't <i>not</i> watch them.\r\n\r\nWhat are the odds on more sequels? There is no reason to continue the 'story', yet that hasn't exactly stopped Netflix before... has it? This one does end with something that feels like a final conclusion though, with no cliffhanger in sight, so we'll see.",
